					<description><![CDATA[Nice post... one of those why-didn&#039;t-I-think-of-this thingies :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actually I&#039;m surprised you haven&#039;t drawn any flak yet for claiming that you were the first in IITM to start the status message culture... I mean atleast I was tweaking status messages long before U2 was nominated for the grammies... and I&#039;m sure there were N people doing it before me...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or was that sentence a misnomer? I mean... what is a status &#039;massage&#039; anyway... lol... cool post da]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,&lt;br/&gt;This post for me was like one status-message-maniac meets another status-message-maniac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I normally spoof up names or people in current affairs and put them as the status message. For eg:&lt;br/&gt;- &quot;Dear-Oh-Bye Ambani&quot; on Dhirubhai Ambani&#039;s Death&lt;br/&gt;- &quot;Subrata Roye&quot; (means &#039;Subrata cries&#039; in Hindi) after the Jet-Sahara Deal was called off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My current one, though, is different. I changed to it post Mumbai blasts. It&#039;s &quot;Waiting for &#039;My Empire&#039; to strike back&quot; a lift from the Star Wars movie title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep &#039;coolshankin&#039;.

<p>I normally spoof up names or people in current affairs and put them as the status message.
