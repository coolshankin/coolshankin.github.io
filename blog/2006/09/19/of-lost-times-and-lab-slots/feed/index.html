					<description><![CDATA[i have mixed opinions for the post. On the face of it, i feel how true is ur post on many parts and also there is a second thought which says, is it exaggeration or too much of sadness in life. I think i am more tending to belive in the former and accept ur views in most places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;to read such a senti post on a rather dull day is all the more morale unboosting ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;The generation which I am proudly a part of is one which thinks it not courteous not ask for a treat on ones birthday, and not snatching a bag of chips from a good friend is sign of a person not having his priorities right.&lt;/i&gt;......&lt;br/&gt;This is bull.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;At the same time, one has to remember that the geeks we are, we also use orkut to ask our neighbour if they are going to mess.&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;You generalize too much, Shankin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though I agree with the first year thing.

					<description><![CDATA[Talking about the weather is better than not talking at all. If someone comes to you and talks to you about the weather, you should not think that they cant think of anything else to talk to you about. Trust me, weather is one of the best ways to start up any conversation. Its the simplest way. Perhaps the guy just wanted to talk to you man, whatever it may be. Dont blame him for choosing a topic that YOU find stale. Your argument is inherently flawed, kid, and shows your own personal opinion or maybe the desperation for a chat on topics that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; think are &quot;cool&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Next time I meet you, trust me, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; gonna talk about the weather.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I will disagree with you here...&lt;br/&gt;I think we interact quite as freely now. Yeah our rooms are a little diffused and all, I do not get to talk to makala or Chameli as often as before, but the distances are not that large either. &lt;br/&gt;About having arguements and discussions, I think, present day people do not feel strongly about anything to be able to talk about it. I think that makes us indifferent to most of the things that can be generally discussed, the things left, to talk about are then the things that you have in common, which you share with only a few. Otherwise well you are stuck talking about the weather, metaphorically, you are talking about some crap like this prof sucks.&lt;br/&gt;It is when we discuss and share our knowledge that we have good interaction. For instance- All of us seem to read the newspaper, how many discussed our views on the pope or Vande Mataram with others? every time you try to start, people will say, let them do what ever they want, let the world go to hell, how does it matter?&lt;br/&gt;As for forming little little groups, I think that is inevitable, we are a promiscuous group, this is bound to happen. But well, we should be open to discussion with all.]]></description>
