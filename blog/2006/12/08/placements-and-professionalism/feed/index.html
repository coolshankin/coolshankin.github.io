			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>to quote some IIT student who got some $100k job without even knowing the job description: &#8220;IITians who go to IIMs are second rate IITians&#8221; &#8230;. who are you kidding mate ?! .. and reading this post i wonder what an IITian can provide that an average lower rung B-schooler cannot..</p>
<p>If the student who asked what does a business analyst mean got selected then DB should close shop&#8230; professionalism means you do your homework, and in the cut throat world of business and $100k salaries, there is no place for &#8220;honest/genuine curiosity&#8221;</p>
<p>having said that, companies do make mistakes&#8230; if this is out of arrogance then they should be put in place&#8230; period.</p>
<p>yet, in all your 21/22 old naivete don&#8217;t forget that these salaries are  only as permanent as the state of the economy &#8211; just 4 years back lots of IITians didn&#8217;t even get jobs&#8230;. </p>
<p>PS: I am also an IITian, so not for one moment think that I don&#8217;t understand the system, or the &#8220;cut throat competition&#8221; that IITians face for 4 years.. the JEE is tough, but the only tough job in campus is making a choice as to what movie to watch today</p>
<p>PPS: I had a good CGPA, good communication skills, and worked in a consult firm when consult/fin firms in campus were more of exceptions than a rule</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Now, before I begin to make my point, lemme state at the outset that:&lt;br/&gt; I personally do not think IIT-ians are arrogant, as many speculate. I have seen quite a few from those glorious institutions to form such an uninformed opinion.&lt;br/&gt; I really think that they deserve the wonderful salaries that the media reports that they get, since they did clear the IIT-JEE (among the toughest exams in the world, without doubt), and did survive 4 years in an extremely competitive environment when they were barely out of their teens.&lt;br/&gt; I do not think the IIT-ians owe anything to the nation or the general public, just because the Government grants some funds to IITs. They are perfectly within their rights to seek a good job in or out of India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, this post was a bit too much for me. You go to an interview, applying for a job that apparently is going to pay you $ 110000 a year. The company has short-listed you because they think that you are among the most elite batch that they are going to get their hands on. You are 21 years old, and have not seen the inside of a corporate office (in other words, in industry parlance, you are still ‘wet-behind-your-ears’, though you are a master when it comes to numerical abilities). You are applying for a job of ‘business analyst’, one they did not prepare you for at an IIT, a position that many others reach after slogging for some years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You go into the interview and ask them, “What does a business analyst mean?” Now, THAT to me is unprofessional. You are perfectly right to think that you are just being genuinely curious, but any interviewer worth his salt would think that you are being cocky. You are going into an interview, you should atleast have done your homework on what position you are interviewing for. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I mean, it is not like they picked you out of some remote village and out you there. You have access to the Internet, some of the best scientific and business magazines from all over the world, and enough alumni in top positions in virtually every business to help you out if you have a doubt. Now, given all that, you go out and ask your interviewer what a ‘business analyst’ means. And, expect them to explain it to you, and get offended when they don’t. Worse still, you accuse them of being unprofessional. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, I wonder whether the salary that they are paying you is worth it, because for all the intellectual capability that you bring to the table, you obviously lack some basic business sense and inter-personal skills.]]></description>
