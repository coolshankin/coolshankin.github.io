					<description><![CDATA[A slightly late comment, but never late then never. This funda about giving respect to a person becasue of his position is good. Some positions show that that person has put some amount of fight to get there. So by default, your first impression must be to respect that. Whether you respect the person or not, comes only after you get to know him. The respect is for the position. He may not deserve the place, but give him a chance to prove himself. For any prof, I do respect him initially, and then depending on how the prof is, my impression of him changes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[wen u put someone on a pedestal u gotta be sure that that person deserves it. else u will end up with a situation where a bunch of morons are up there and all of them demand respect. this should be avoided. the only way to avoid this is by constantly questioning the reason as to why the guy is up there [analogous to process control, if u will - keep checking and reviewing]. blindly placing a person in a position of power esp. as a teacher of 5 yr olds[ the age at which they are the most susceptible to external influence] is risky. you have to be sure that they deserve the position. it does not mean that u ask the children to question their teacher, [cause at that point they wont be capable of doing it] but you have to do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;maro]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes,I agree with you that we have no dignity of labour.It does not matter how much one earns by doing the job the importance of the job has to be recognised and no one must be thought of as small bcos of what he does.But I am still convinced that teaching is not just another profession.When a 5yr old goes to school I don&#039;t see anything wrong in telling him to respect ur teacher.If we does not respect his teacher how will he learn from him?I heard that the Dean does not allow outside food bcos it is not hygenic,he has no probs with Minar though :-).By the way why did u have to drag this Indian culture into all this?? I am sure having a quiz after Diwali does not do any good to Indian culture.I am sure they have&#039;nt put exams on the day after christmas to safeguard our culrure.I think u sub-conciusly wanted to give &quot;such&quot; people a bashing :-).But here it is out of context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S.Manohar]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@deepak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;i am not saying having exams after hols leads to brain drain, there are million other factors to it. If anyone whats to keep the students in the country, he has to keep them happy too. when all it takes is being a bit more polite, i dont understand their problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;one major factor why people dont come back to india is corruption and that senirors take you for granted. who would want to come back if he is  being bullied around. i am speaking of a larger picture here. these things leave a bad taste. if such incidents dont happen, more people would consider coming back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;@ashish&lt;br/&gt;not everyone thinks like you ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;@maro&lt;br/&gt;yup, its not just teacher who demand it. its the entire society.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ deepak - there seems to be a misunderstanding here.. plz read the post again&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;@comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;this system where one is supposed to respect a person just because he holds a certain office is ridiculous. this is seen throughout our society not just in the education system. remember that old guy on the bus. he was a complete jackass but he expected us to respect him because he was older than us[ref - the elbow bumping incident]. if someone wants the others to respect him, then he has to earn it. it cannot be just given to him. also people in the position of power tend to  abuse it, but not much can be done about it [ref - rkk the SOB]. this has been going on for quite a while in our society and changing it will require a lot of effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maro]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I seriously fail to understand one thing. How can having exams after holidays lead to brain drain?&lt;br/&gt;Do u mean to say that if a law were to be passed to ensure that no exams were conducted immediately after holidays, brain drain would stop? You being in IIT, should be knowing better. Brain drain is happening because there are no good PG institutes in India, not because students feel revenge towards India for scheduling exams just after holidays.]]></description>
