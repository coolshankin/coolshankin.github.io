By saying &quot;Well, are you paying the American labourer as low as the Chinese labourer because you can get away with it &quot; You are making the issue truly one dimensional. The fact is there is one more player in the equation: the government. Government is responsible for setting rules that ensure a fair game. period.

Analogy: US govt. sets maximum speed of 20mph on roads with schools. Indian road transport authority has no such rule. I am sure 100% of people here will drive at much greater speeds through such roads in India, if there is no traffic etc. Does this mean we disregard the lives of school children. No. Humans have the tendency of operating as close to the limit as they sense practical. And back to your point: this applies both to the businessman and the laborer. Within their own game, the businessman is trying to maximise his profit, while the laborer is trying to maximise what his body can earn.

Directly (by setting a minimum wage) or setting fair labour rule, it is the role of the government to set rules that permit a fair game. In a democracy, it comes from the people (the workers election). In a communist government, it comes through social unrest (when the workers ultimately get fed up of exploitation)]]></description>

Well, are you paying the American labourer as low as the Chinese labourer because you can get away with it or because you genuinly believe that the low salary is what they deserve? If it is the former, you will change your rate depending on the bargaing power of the other guy. If it is the later, you will be consistant (and reluctantly pay more, only if necessary). If you understand my post, you will know my answer to your question.

UPDATE: When I am talking about being consistant, a relavant question to ask is if I would pay my future self the same pay as I am paying the Chinese/American worker now? Then you will know if you are really consistant with your idea about what is the good pay for a job. When you really believe that it is the deserving pay, you will pay your future self the same amount too. But if you are just doing that to get away with it, you will have a different rules for your future self.

Read this: You will see how equality plays a role in deciding a just society:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&quot;How would you define a just society?&quot;

&quot;A moral philosopher called John Rawls attempted to say something about it with the following example: Imagine you were a member of distinguished council whose task it was to make all the laws for a future society.&quot;
&quot;I wouldn&#039;t mind at all being on that council.&quot;
&quot;They are obliged to consider absolutely every detail, because as soon as they reach an agreement - and everybody has signed the laws - they will all drop dead.&quot;
&quot;Oh...&quot;
&quot;But they will immediately come to life again in the society they have legislated for. The point is that they have no idea which position they will have in society.&quot;
&quot;Ah, I see.&quot;
&quot;That society would be a just society. It would have arisen among equals.&quot;

My framework is a philosophical one. I made the disclaimer early enough. My framework can only be used in money transactions. It is not a one-size-fits-all framework. In the context of Chinese workers and American workers, how is their social or cultural difference relevant to the factory working floor? In that context, both the workers are equal as long they are equally productive.  In the context of entrance examinations, two candidates are not equal according to some people. And those who make the argument in favour of merit assume that the two candidates are equal. I do not see how my framework violates any fundamental principle here. It can be used only when the two parties are considered equal. Whether or not they are indeed equal is a different debate altogether. I do not see anything wrong with my framework itself.]]></description>

Well that is the subjective part. That is the judgmenth call i was takking about. You may consider them to be equal while others may not.

Shankar : that&#039;s justice not equality. Discrimination based on performance , merit is considered just and fair. I am granting that discrimination in favor of sc/st is fair, and just and to achieve it one must discriminate. Equality alone is fundamentally insufficient to define fairness since no two people or situations are perfectly &quot;equal&quot;. It will have to be a balance.]]></description>

When two equal people are treated differently, I see that as unfair. In the case of Chinese and American workers, they both work equally hard, but one get paid more than the other. That is what I call unfair. 

In the reservation case, an SC/ST candidate and an upper-class candidate are not considered equal. So the application of my framework does not arise. The preconditions are not met. The whole reason for reservation is ensure a level playing field. That&#039;s nothing but equality. You discriminate in favour of a weaker candidate to bring equality. When is this discrimination fair or unfair? This needs a different framework altogether.

And as far as my example is considered, it may not be goods I am producing, I may be just paying them to shine my shoes.]]></description>

There exist many ways of looking at it. The objective is fairness/justice ( not equality ) is achieved through discrimination. Even those opposing reservation say - &quot;Do discriminate us on the basis of our merit and merit alone&quot;. I am only saying that discrimination is as much a cornerstone of fairness/justice as is equality. It is a judgment as to who are equals and who are unequals, on what grounds are the equal and unequal etc. Where should equality stop and discrimination take over, or where discrimination should stop and equality must take over , and on what grounds etc are the questions to ponder about. 

The idea of fairness that acts as a front for equality completely delegitimises  discrimination on all grounds. That&#039;s my central point. 

Shankar : Your example is simply not holistic at all. The goods you produce by paying 100 Rs or 70 Rs will cost more or less depending on what you pay. Now what would be fair to consumers ? So you lose the balance and only end up being selectively fair.]]></description>

The reservation is based on the assumption that a SC/ST candidate and an upper-class candidate are not equal due to historical reasons. The objective of the reservation policy is to make them equal (in a generation or so). It is a different debate as to whether the assumption is true and whether the objective is being achieved. &quot;Youth for equality,&quot; which opposes reservation say that the assumption is not true today and reservation makes things unequal, and is therefore unfair. In either case, people are in favour of bringing equality.

 
&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-956&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@Subhash Lakshminarayana &lt;/a&gt; 
I am talking about the a person (or an institution) being fair to everyone else. If you genuinely believe that your workers deserve a meal&#039;s worth of money for 5 hours of work, but you provide them a meal for ten hours of work, I think that you are being unfair to the workers. Whether you are in China or the US, you have to provide same salary (adjusted to purchasing power parity and inflation) to both workers. Chinese workers live is a small room with five other workers. They work for more than 60 hours a week. Their conditions are far worse than American workers. But I am sure that the executive believe that the workers deserve better, but the reason why executives are paying the workers so little is because they can get away with it. That is what I call unfair. Like you said, no one would complain if the conditions are acceptable, but the conditions are so bad that it can only be explained as exploitation.

UPDATE:

To clarify my position: suppose that the &quot;market rate&quot; for a job is $50. Both of you think that $50 is too less and pay the worker $70 (you think that $70 is fair). Suppose I know that the market rate is $50 and that you both paid $70, but I think that $100 is the fair price. If I pay $75 for the same job, I am being unfair because I paid less then what I thought was the true price. At the same time, I think that you both are fair because you paid what you believed was the true price. 

UPDATE 2:

This is how my UPDATE relates to equality. Regardless of who bargains with you, you will stick to $70 as the price for the job (or reluctantly pay more). On the other hand, I would change my price depending on how desparate the other guy is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Shankar,

Your models are good but the big question is whose &quot;fairness&quot; are we talking about?
Obviously, it has to be the fairness of the soceity as a whole. In this context, I think the basic problem is that you are forgetting to take into account a lot of factors which matter in this case.

Firstly, the playing conditions. This also relates to Manohar&#039;s point of differentiating between &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;equality.&quot; However, I do not quite agree with his statment that &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; are two conflicting objectives. Infact, &quot;equaility&quot; is just one particular notion of &quot;fairness.&quot; Specifically, equality is a notion of fairness under an ideal scenario given that playing conditions are identical. Consider for example the cost of living. Obviously, the cost of living in China is much lower than US. So it does not make any sense to from an employers point of view to pay 200$ to an engineer in China. With the knowledge that to provide the same living conditions an employer has to pay lesser in China, any employer will choose China for less than $200.
If one stupidly decides to pay $200 to a worker in China too (which is what equality theory would do),we will lose out on the productivity and hence the profits.

Secondly, the &quot;law of dimishing returs.&quot; To put it simply, if your income today is $1 and you get an appraisal of $1, you gain an increase of 100%. At the same time if your income today is $10, an appraisal of 1$ means only means 10% increase. Hence, the &quot;satisfaction&quot;
obtained from an appraisal of $1 is different depending on you current level  of income. Remember that an average person living in USA has a much higher current income than a person living in China. So if one looks an it from a purely fairness point of view, the new investment has to go to China because the increase in the level of satisfaction is much higher.

I think the point where  it starts to be bad is when corporates exploit people by providing them with extremely bad working conditions and exploiting the workers (which is the real issue with Foxconn). But this is a seprate issue and needs to be addressed separately.]]></description>

<p>Your models are good but the big question is whose &#8220;fairness&#8221; are we talking about?<br />
Obviously, it has to be the fairness of the soceity as a whole. In this context, I think the basic problem is that you are forgetting to take into account a lot of factors which matter in this case.</p>
<p>Firstly, the playing conditions. This also relates to Manohar&#8217;s point of differentiating between &#8220;fairness&#8221; and &#8220;equality.&#8221; However, I do not quite agree with his statment that &#8220;fairness&#8221; and &#8220;equality&#8221; are two conflicting objectives. Infact, &#8220;equaility&#8221; is just one particular notion of &#8220;fairness.&#8221; Specifically, equality is a notion of fairness under an ideal scenario given that playing conditions are identical. Consider for example the cost of living. Obviously, the cost of living in China is much lower than US. So it does not make any sense to from an employers point of view to pay 200$ to an engineer in China. With the knowledge that to provide the same living conditions an employer has to pay lesser in China, any employer will choose China for less than $200.<br />
