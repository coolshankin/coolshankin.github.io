					<description><![CDATA[Long time since I visited your blog...good post.

And I agree with you that all who app are not anti-national. I cannot blame an individual for doing what is most beneficial for him personally, and, in an ideal society, any individual who does what is best for himself while staying legally and ethically correct should automatically contribute positively to the society. And this is true even in our far-from-ideal society today in my opinion...any individual who improves his skillset definitely contributes positively to the country&#039;s growth in some way or the other, on an average. Those who stay in India turn out to be some of the biggest earners/enterpreneurs, and those who dont send back large amounts of money, be it to their family or to charity. Although it is definitely fair to expect iitians to work a bit harder and turn out better research (or some research atleast) during their ug days, the government cannot expect every iitian to join iisc/csir/some other govt research agency after their b.tech.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@deepak
storming the plane is like treating the symptom with extreme possible side effect of killing large number of innocents. i am against that. 

as far as calling Palestine a rough nation is concerned .... going by history, it was Israel (Jews from Germany etc) which (with help of US and UK) occupied Palestine and not the other way around.

abt capital punishment .. i mostly agree with you.... i gave my opinion only on serial killers. i dont want them to be free. i want them to be kept in metal hospital even if it costs a _lot_ of money (society is responsible for it anyway). i just dont want them killed because that would mean treating them like lab rats. in other cases .... i am not sure if capital punishment is good.

i will look at the site sometime when i have the time. its 3 am now]]></description>

This is not related to this topic, but to a blog which you posted close to 2 years ago on Islam-minorityism-secularism etc. etc. Go through this site:
www.prophetofdoom.net

It&#039;s interesting. It is the proof for what I said then.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with u on the point of erroneously labeling people desirous of wanting their family members back as anti-national. 
Regarding storming of hijacked planes, India might not have such a policy, but there is one country that does - Israel. Israel has a policy of no negotiation with terrorists. I would disagree with you when you say that if planes would be stormed, hijackers would themselves crash the plane!!! Hijacking planes is not their profession! Hijacking is a means to an end - which in the Kandahar case was the release of 4 terrorists. If a country is prepared to storm the hijacked plane and accept casualties, terrorists would no longer resort to such tactics. But of course, the decision to storm / negotiate is a country-specific issue, which is also shaped by the unique circumstances being faced by it, in the case of Israel, being surrounded by enemies and rogue nations. 
Regarding capital punishment, killing someone in self defense is perfectly acceptable, at least in countries with a well developed legal system where the law is respected. In dictatorial / communist regimes, one can never know why a person is convicted! The law should take into account the motive of the action, which is done in countries where the law of the land is supreme, and not in countries where power is held with dictators. 
I strongly disagree with ur statement that psychopathic serial killers shouldn&#039;t be hanged. In my view, such anti-social persons deserve harsh punishment, since they aren&#039;t fit to live in a society. Their upbringing may have a strong bearing on the way they turned out, but that is no excuse for putting other innocent lives at stake. If it is established that they are mentally challenged, they should be put in a mental hospital under tight security, but in no way should they be allowed to mingle with the general public until they are fit to live in a society. 
There is one very easy answer to those who claim NRIs to be anti-national - the whopping amount of money that they send back to their relatives and family. In a recent survey, it was found that Indians sent the highest amount of remittances to their homes!!!]]></description>
