					<description><![CDATA[Hey..this seems like a common plea of all the Indian students out there in USA?? Such little things and the mentalities that I wouldnt give much though to here on Indian grounds. And look at a writer&#039;s mind giving it an observing look! 
(Aww..Shankar! The Tokyo story...quite funny. :D )



Oh! btw..I&#039;m &quot;jobless&quot; this weekend..shall come online. Cya then. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ manohar
lingo is fun. its wrong. but it is fun

@amith
people call me shankaar when read my name. i dont attempt to correct them. it&#039;s close enough.

@deepak
i guess they are different ..  did not think much before writing it. when i was practicing for GRE, i came across a reading comprehension passage in translation and how it is impossible to translate things exactly from one language to another. they are bound to be some differences. I was reminded of that. so i decided to write about it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice article, it takes effort to adjust to different surroundings, but, if one doesn&#039;t, he/she risks being treated as an outcaste. 

P.S I didn&#039;t understand how something being &quot;lost in translation&quot; is related to &quot;cultural insensitivity&quot;. 
One thing that I have seen, things like &quot;lost in translation&quot;, &quot;multiple interpretation&quot;, &quot;coincidence&quot; are used by those who prefer ambiguity to certainty. Maybe it makes them more comfortable, maybe ambiguity leads to a good night&#039;s sleep!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shankar,

There were some interesting observations in your post. On that note, have you ever had people mispronounce your name? I have all but given up on trying to get people to pronounce my name correctly to the point where I don&#039;t know the right way myself until I talk to my mother. It really isn&#039;t hard, but I think it stems from predefined notions. Everyone&#039;s mind is a little colored with preconceived notions.

On a more humorous note, I was at a bar yesterday and a little buzzed after a beer tasting escapade at the brewery when I met a guy shooting pool at the table next to mine. After we said &#039;Hi&#039; to each other, he guessed I was Indian and told be he was a Sherpa. At this point, my ignorant self said something along the lines of &quot;Aayo Gorkhali&quot;. The guy simply said that he wasn&#039;t a Gorkha and they were very different. I&#039;m sure I offended him greatly because he didn&#039;t seem to smile much after that fiasco.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see any problem with the lingo actually. People who hear it for the first time may feel awckward but I dont think it will always create confusion. Every sentence has a &quot;artha&quot;(literal meaning) and a &quot;bhava&quot;(context+emotions etc). Bhava is like a error correction code. We have o make use of it thats all. So is a listener is sensitive to these both I am sure he will understand when u say &quot;I am jobless this weekend&quot; because of the previous conversation and context. When a father tells his son , &quot;I will break ur hand&quot; the son knows that his father is just angry and wont really break his hand.  We always donot understand the sentence by it&#039;s literal meaning.

Moreover, lingo is fun :-)]]></description>
