					<description><![CDATA[I agree that FB, twitter etc.. are powerful media to upgrade the knowledge -&#039;common knowledge&#039;
On NOTA:
Nota can opted for the following reasons
-I want to reject all candidates
-I do not want to vote and my vote should not be misused by others
-I do not want to participate in this election (some areas boycotted the election process)
-I am not interested in this democratic process

A voter presses NOTA button intentionally, that means it not INVALID.
It is valid and tells the Election commission to take care of the election process in a better way. Hence it is a powerful option for voter. If NOTAs are more, political parties have to correct themselves and governance to be improved. 
Instead of boycotting the election process, opt for NOTA and thereby attract political parties&#039; attention.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-1029&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@Mahesh &lt;/a&gt; 
Thanks! Yes, the role of the media is to make things common knowledge. I am not all that comfortable with compulsory voting, but it is really just a very minor inconvenience (a lot less inconvenient than filing taxes every year before a deadline) if voting booth are not far away and a holiday is declared. With NOTA and the option to reject all candidates, I am neutral to it. And yeah, my writing style is very academic, and I think it is a good thing :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice one Shankar! Great take on how twitter and facebook made some issues common knowledge. My two cents:
1) Your point on Twitter is well taken, I think there is a subtler point here. In an open society it is the role of media to make issues &quot;common knowledge&quot;. Obviously in states with high government control, media doesnt fulfill this responsibility. Thats where uncontrollable outlets like Twitter and Facebook provide the necessary medium. 
2) Your point about the NOTA is the first credible reason for NOTA I have come across. I always felt what would NOTA achieve? What would happen if the majority vote went to NOTA? Anyway, I think in a democracy it is irresponsible to not vote. I always felt that along with NOTA there should be a requirement that everyone should vote, absent exigent circumstances. I dont think one has a fundamental right not to vote, but one has a fundamental right not to choose any candidates on the ballot. Thats where NOTA comes in. 

P.S. : Which journal are you submitting this paper to?]]></description>
