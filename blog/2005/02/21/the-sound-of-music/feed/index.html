					<description><![CDATA[Hey,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must tell you guys that I love Indian music too. Some of my friends complained about the absence of reference to Indian music. I do love songs like &#039;dooba dooba&#039; by silk route etc. What I hate is the  attitude with which other genres of music are seen by the &#039;cool&#039; guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same friends also complained about their hasitation to post a comment because anonymous indentity was not enabled. Well, now i know who are most likely to be the first to write an anonymous comment here. (this is not an invitation to post anonymous comments just to pain me)]]></description>
