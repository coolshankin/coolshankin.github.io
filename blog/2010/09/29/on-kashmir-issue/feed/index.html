					<description><![CDATA[Hey Shankin, heavy issue. But good to see you have done your research.
Anyway, my take on it: Sitting away from Kashmir, we cant say if it is Kashmiris who want to secede or is it a political agenda. When India and Pakistan were split up, can you say that people really wanted it and that it was not heavily influenced by political play, given the blood-shed it led to. Look at Punjab, there was a serious separatist movement which was crushed ( in the worst possible way by Indira Gandhi ), but now Punjab is an integral part of India, &quot;enjoying&quot; all the benefits of being a part of it. Why cant this be used as an arguement for similar steps in Kashmir. Maybe people of Punjab did really want to secede.
I can see why ordinary Kashmiris might want to just split from India. Their problems have gone on for ages, there might be a drive to just end this whole mess. Political power play is more important in these issues than anything else. Democracy is supposed to give weightage to peoples opinion, but if all the parties involved are just being selfish, there is no way out. I really think if the politicians really wanted to, this issue would have been resolved long time ago, without need of an army etc. With no side really giving up something, there has been a deadlock for so long, that it might never be resolved unless something major happens. ( I can think of many distributed systems analogies here, talk about being a GEEK .... )]]></description>
