That&#039;s exactly what I am saying. Calling American, Pakistani or Indians as hypocrites, terrorists or traitors is as much of a stereotype as calling muslims as terrorists. Just because the governments are democratically elected doesn&#039;t mean they really follow people&#039;s wishes. 

I am not shying away from the process. I think the misunderstanding arose because I was talking about individuals while you were talking about the whole group of people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-910&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@Manohar Seetharam &lt;/a&gt; 

1. You are confusing a couple of things: Facing the good/bad consequences and taking the credit/blame. I face the both good and bad consequences of the system. Good consequences include my education and bad consequences include the bribes I had to pay to get my passport and DL. But I do not take credit either. I think DRDO, ISRO and related ministries did a great job and they deserve the credit for that they did and not me. I dont take credit for RTI. Similarly, I am not responsible for decisions of the govt I do not support. I hope you understand the distinction. There is no hypocrisy here. 

2. You have an ideal view of the democracy. My point in the post is that democracy today is far from ideal. Lobbyists and citizens are not on a level field. To claim otherwise is naive. 

3. Logical end for your argument is that you should also go to jail for our crimes in Kashmir and North East. Lets not get into logical ends of either of our argument. 

Your views have no hypocrisy. That&#039;s why I respect it. My views aren&#039;t hypocritical either. Lets agree that we disagree.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately that&#039;s a luxury that cannot be granted to citizens. Whatever the system that allows for lobbies to influence decisions also provided-for the citizens. Citizens cannot stake a claim to only the fruits of the system and distance themselves when it comes to other issues. Strictly on moral grounds it&#039;s not acceptable. Then give up your degrees which state funds, give up your security benefits. The logical end of this argument will be to claim,&quot; I am an independent, mobile republic&quot; like Roy claims and show it in action. Then I will agree with you. She still enjoys state patronage, that&#039;s a different issue though. As things stand &quot;You&quot; and &quot;I&quot; don&#039;t have the right to feel victimised.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-907&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@Manohar Seetharam &lt;/a&gt; 
I agree with you. The problem is that an individual is insignificant in global affairs, but global affairs are significant to an individual. Terrorism (in US, India or Pakistan) is a result of what their respective governments did to their own people or others. Despite a fairly-big support base (Roy and Sen, for example), it is very hard to undo lobby-dicated government policies and actions. Regardless of who is in power, same lobbies dictate the governement policies. Yes, it is in our best interest to also fight for others&#039; rights, but &quot;I&quot; feel victimised when &quot;I&quot; am held responsible for something over which &quot;I&quot; do not have control. I assume it is the same for a regular Pakistani or an American.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shankar : It seems that many citizens have varied level of attachments with their country. Citizens typically are expected to be active in national and political life of a country, the job of politicisation of the masses is of Political parties and media. In your wordlview there is too much focus on an individual (symbolised by the many I&#039;s). But you Shankar  or me Manohar are irrelevant in global affairs. Also, citizen-state relations are typically much more closer than what you point out in your case. Nations are at the right hierarchy where sanctions can be enforced. In pursuit of over rationalisation we must not ignore realism. The reality is in todays world even something as basic as truth can be and must be negotiated. So, if &quot;I&quot; don&#039;t back my state or strive to correct it &quot;MY&quot; interests will be traded off.]]></description>

&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-904&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@Manohar Seetharam &lt;/a&gt; 

I respect your opinions. My point with this post was not to be hypocritical about blaming other people but not taking the blame yourself. If you are willing to take the blame, you have every right to blame others too. At the same time, if you hold everyone accountable, you should be willing to give or take credit for good decisions. Are you willing to share credit for what PVN and Manmohan Singh&#039;s liberalistion? Are you willing to give credit to _all_ Americans for raid on Bin Laden, not just SEALs and the president?

I am of the opinion that people who make those decisions should given credit for it. I wont take credit for many good things India did because I did not have a hand in it. I wont take blame for bad things either. I will try my best to correct the mistakes of others, but I wont go out of the way to do that. If I become rich, I will lobby for what I think is right. If not, I am as helpless as Arundati Roy or Binayak Sen (not that I completely agree with them).

PS: When terrorists kill common people in India, Pakistan or US, do you call the people who are killed as innocent people? If you do, you are contradicting yourself. If you don&#039;t, you are at a risk of legitimising terrorism as a war.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You point to deficiencies in the democratic processes as it is practiced in most nations today. I get a feeling that these shortcomings can only be overcome in a direct democracy set up where people would gather and themselves take a view on all major decisions. However, in a representative democracy decision making is to be done by the people&#039;s representatives. We are nations, we want to be nations, and we will be nations for the foreseeable future. Hence we must have some kind of set norms about fixing accountability for actions, failing which a dangerous sense of anomie would prevail. Also, this argument clearly cuts both ways, to US and to Pakistan. Americans who have enjoyed benefits like social security and Britons who have enjoyed state welfare measures like NHS are beneficiaries of the hegemony their nations enjoy and the actions they enforce in the world stage. This also holds for the Bank employees who drew the big bonuses etc. There is a clear moral and financial dimension to it. These norms have been used and deemed acceptable till now. When India conducted Pokhran in 1998 there was no referendum taken to see where all citizens stand, but sanctions were imposed that impacted all of us. It is a valid political option for one sovereign nation to use it&#039;s power to further it&#039;s interests, citizens will be at the gaining and loosing ends both depending on time and place.]]></description>
