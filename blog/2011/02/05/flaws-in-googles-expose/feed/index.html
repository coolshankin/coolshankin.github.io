					<description><![CDATA[&quot;heavily&quot;???? 9 of 100 synthetic queries is not &quot;heavily.&quot; Also, in research, it is common to show that your algorithm performing better than others by fine-tuning the constants in your formula but not doing the same in the other algorithms. 

In this case, Google was the only input signal. For less-than-common queries, there are other input signals and Bing, presumably, will not rely on Google. I did say, &quot;In the next update, Bing should try and reduce its dependence on that to be fair.&quot;

Google found out Bing&#039;s vulnerability to cases where Google is the only input signal. It&#039;s a super-specific case. Google will be vulnerable, too. It is just the question of finding out what it is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i would beg to differ. google said that bing copies its results, which is different from saying that bing is a ripoff off google. it is obvious that all search engines will perform well on frequent queries. Google success has been due to its performance in the &quot;long tail&quot; of search terms. This experiment highlights that for less frequent queries, bing is heavily relying on google, something that they have partly acknowledged (officially).]]></description>
