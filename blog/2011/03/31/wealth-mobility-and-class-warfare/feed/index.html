					<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-862&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@Manohar Seetharam &lt;/a&gt; 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States This link gives you a plot of effective tax-rate as a function of the income. It goes from 10% for $1000 income per annum to 30% for 500,000 income per annum. Given the inequality is the US ( http://www.slate.com/id/2266025/entry/2266026 ) and the reasons for it, and given the fact that rich keep getting richer and poor get poorer, I believe it has to be increase for the rich. Check out the slate.com link in this comment. That gives you a very objective, statistical proof for all the claims the writer makes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shankar : Can you briefly explain what exactly this tax break for the rich in US is ? Is it like a tax holiday where the rich guys pay zero tax or more like they pay the same tax as a percentage of their income as the middle class ?]]></description>
