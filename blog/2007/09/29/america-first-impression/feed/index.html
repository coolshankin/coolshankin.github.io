1. what i meant was because there are no intl matches, regional or club football becomes important. so you simply cannot say that cricket is not popular as junta dont follow domestic cricket. cricket _is_ popular .... i am on your side

2. insti is way better. green here is &#039;garden green&#039;, not natural green.

3. &quot;you never know when someone]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[pretty harmless post and ppl already taking sides, starting arguments!
frankly, these are some of the not so controversial opinions of coolshankin. he&#039;s said/written lots more argument worthy stuff in the past.

about the post, i disagree with you on a few things
1) you&#039;ve to goto shivaji park in Mumbai on a hot sunny afternoon to realize the kinda craze that indians have for Cricket. We out do Americans with sheer numbers. be it number of gully cricket matches going on at any given point of time or the number of eyes glued to the TV set during a match. so i believe that your point about the craze for baseball and foot ball there being same as that of cricket in India is not valid unless you have statistics to prove me otherwise. heck, they call it world series and play within states whereas a cricket world series is actually played by 3 or more countries!

2) i believe insti Campus is as green as it gets. yeah, B&#039;lore  = garden city is trippy only. i&#039;m curious to know where insti greenery stands in comparison to US of A.

3) Indians are ruder. not rudest. ruder compared to a few others. thats probably because noone put racism laws here to bring down the rudeness. and education goes a long way in this regard. Half of India doesn&#039;t even know what sorry or thank you means!
and here&#039;s a twisted take on the issue. I believe that ppl there are insecure and this insecurity comes out as niceness. you never know when someone&#039;s gonna bomb you down, when the kid next to you is gonna go on a shooting spree etc. so being nice and polite to the guy next to you would probably increase your chances of survival. :P

nice post. write often. looking forward to NYC pics!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@mahesh
i will blog at least once a month
@tak
yeah, indians dont mix well ... already i have seen regional groups (let alone indian groups) forming here in penn state .... thats kinda sad.
@vishwa
i will start praising india when i see the shortcoming here ..... i have couple of points ready already  :)
@brado
my room mate&#039;s dad told us the same thing when we told him that we wished to go back to india .... you get used to this life and when you go back, the rudeness hits like a shock to you.
@gantek
earlier last year when i survey came out .... i did not believe it either. i thought whatever happened abroad was too artificial .... it is not all that artificial ..... it feels good to know that people respect your personal space

abt the connection ... its not about one this one thing .... how about the intern rule? the pizza delivery rule? the lack of respect shown by profs/teachers is many aspects makes you wanna get away from the place. when someone else is treating you so well, why would anyone wanna come back? check out http://www.coolshankin.com/blog/2006/11/12/taken-for-granted/ .... it talks about how callously students are treated .... it is combination of all the factors ......

you wouldn&#039;t leave you dad because he got you a cycle when you performed well and a computer when you wanted one ...... the administration goes out of the way to punish you, but does it reward you when anything good happens? giving good grade or bad grade is their duty ... not allowing to write exams for 30 mins is not their duty .... thats plain sadism.

we should be objective about it. not implements rules because they say so. if a policeman gives a ticket to a guy during at 66 mph when speed limit is 65 ... i will call it ridiculous. on a bright sunny day upto 70-72 mph are excused .. not on a rainy day as you are risking many lives when you speed. the rule was to ensure student attend exam on time .... that has been achieved. i am not saying students are not at fault . they are .. just like i was ..... i was treated much better here then the juniors ... all thing put together ... i like this place better .....

yes, india had subsidized my education ... i am sure i will give something back for that ..... in return i expect to be treated like a human being who makes mistakes and should be given a second chance .... a lil courtesy goes a long way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never been abroad. So I&#039;ll see things from that perspective !

reg Indians begin rude -&#062;  That&#039;s not true.. Indians are not rude..! I have seen atleast 2-3 government offices (for e.g take the IITM post office) where they treat us with a lot of respect. And yes.... even if Indians are really rude.. I wouldn&#039;t complain about it in a place where people from other countries can see it.

reg brain drain and quizzes ---&#062; ROTFL at the connection. How do you connect the two at all ??

&quot;Back in IITM, in my last year, there was circular sent saying student have to be in exam hall at 8:50 for 9:00 am exam. It was more of a guideline everyone thought.&quot;

If we take the liberty to understand the circular as we deem fit.. I feel it&#039;s our mistake and not theirs.

And most importantly.. if people feel that they won&#039;t stay back here just because their HOD didn&#039;t allow them to write an exam... my suggestion to them would be &quot;Please do so.. you are not required here&quot; This is as foolish as saying my father shouted at me for something.. or he didn&#039;t allow to do so and so.. and hence I will not talk to him anymore.. ! Whatever fart !!!

and reg the intern decision: My initial reactions were similar.. but on second thoughts.. they might be right.

@Brado : Health getting affected ?? You talk as if you&#039;ve been bought up in Singapore all your life. :) I had a similar experience with one of my cousins  who had come here during his vacation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many of these impressions are very true. I too realised them during my six month stint in Singapore. Coming back to Chennai was definitely a bit of a shock - after six months of polite and helpful people, indifference and basic uncivility in chennai struck me like a brick - and i&#039;m still smarting from it :) And the pollution and dust is horrible(I may be sounding so bloody-uncouth-Indians types, but hell, my health is getting affected!) Can&#039;t drive without avoiding dust getting into your eyes. And yes of course, the indifference at IIT... Seriously, do they expect us to be groveling at their feet? More moronic decisions like the intern decision and people wouldn&#039;t think twice about tellin bye bye... Even the scare of an exit tax doesn&#039;t seem to deter many - guess junta have given up so much :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post.  I have been in this country a little longer than you have, which is why these are not striking to me.  But, you have made quite a few interesting observations.  Of course, the taste buds suffer a lot during the stay in America especially if you are vegetarian.  On an aside, It is really interesting to see how the Chinese have been able to build their little &#039;Chinatowns&#039; all over the US.  But the one disappointing thing that I see about the Indians and Chinese here is their lack of interest in learning about other cultures.   We tend to want to stick together in the same little groups which is kind of disappointing with all the international students here with the rich cultural background and varied upbringing.

Anyways, hope you will really enjoy your stay in PSU.  Cheers to a good life in US!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[AH!! after so long! Well, i havent been in US for as long as you, but i always knew that for a common man, its much easier to live here. I think it is true. People are kind here. But i wouldnt say people would frown back home. I particularly noticed this in India in the last three months in Blore, I met a lot of people in the buses. Everything online here does help , so does all the money that is spent into building the system. Face it India is still pretty poor. Attitude of profs ( obviously a general comment, not specific) is waaaay better here. They tend to respect the students here, unlike some profs back home.....
And AMerican food is so bland! Maybe we should carry chilli powder along with us everywhere we go.]]></description>
