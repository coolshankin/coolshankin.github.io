					<description><![CDATA[@aswin
yup .... govt shouldn;t interfere much
@naresh
nice point ... but if it is basic amenities, people are forced to buy it .... but then when i read &quot;because i think this situation will go a full circle and come to a stablilized position&quot;, i figured... if  prices rise, the industry (agricultural or otherwise) in villages will rise prices and things will still stabilize ... nice :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[interesting...
hmmm...
I dont see a need for any major intervention by the govt other than some revenue taxes, because i think this situation will go a full circle and come to a stablilized position.
something like - these big marts will take over and dominate the villages. More such competitors will show up... the pricing wars will keep a check.
Or lets say there&#039;s only one biggun in the village. That will ruin the local economy as you claimed and the purchasing power of the people will go down. His profits will drop and he&#039;ll be forced to reduce prices.
Or as someone pointed out, an uprising by the small traders can take care of the problem a la French Revolution. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm...I don&#039;t like the idea of government imposing itself on anything, to be honest, in any way. It is all very well to say that extreme capitalism is bad, but where does one draw the line for intervention. Also, all government intervention assumes two things: a)Good thinking b)Competent execution.
Unfortunately, in a system made of human beings, neither of these can be guaranteed. After all, let us not forget that the sub-prime crisis earlier talked about was precipitated by intervention following a previous crisis (dot-com bust). This is why I completely support the market economy.

As far as retail is concerned, I think I have made my points on the discussion you referred to and will desist from doing so again here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
First of all, happy new year to u.
Nextly, in a free market system, survival of fittest is a given. Someone has to make way for others. In India, we saw the closure of several big but inefficient companies when licence raj was abolished.
Coming to retail, studies done in many countries of the world have shown that mom-and-pop stores can survive along with big retailers. In China, after 10 years of 100% FDI in retail, organized retailers control only 10% of the retail market. In India, a study is being done to find out the impact of big retail on mom-and-pop stores. Small retailers do have their unique advantages, which would be honed to perfection when faced with competition. Some job loss would occur, but not so much as to create a social upheaval.
Of course, too much of everything is bad, even capitalism (subprime crisis). But, capitalism is definitely the lesser evil compared to socialism or communism. The proof is the failure of socialism / communism everywhere in the world. Soviet Union disintegrated, East Germans crossed over to West Germany, Cubans still flee to US at the cost of their lives and so on...]]></description>
