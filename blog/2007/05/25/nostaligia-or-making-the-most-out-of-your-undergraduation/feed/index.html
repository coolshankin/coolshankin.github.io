					<description><![CDATA[Nice post Shankar. I concur with most of what you say. But, I think why people miss out on so many things during undergraduation is that they simply don&#039;t know it&#039;s there. although many people I know have a record of some sort of spending more time in the canteen than the classrooms in 4 years.. &lt;br/&gt;and ya.. we&#039;ll keep in touch man.]]></description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>@ggop<br />this post was more about under graduation than about under graduation at iit &#8230; it is very nice to listen to diverse views from non-engineering background. they have a completely different set of ideas</p>
<p>@TheTobacconist<br />i hope psu will be fun too like you say</p>
<p>@anil p<br />education system has to be revamped to include a few more courses and reduce specialized courses at undergraduate level</p>
<p>@chennu<br />i really did not get to know him that well unfortunately .. some of his classes were very good.</p>
<p>@mahesh<br />everyone misses out on a few things üôÅ will respond to your post as and when its up</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I was a fool not to be involved in organization of Shaastra or Saarang. I did take part in competetions but I simply wasnt good enouh to win any of them. What a collosal waste. Anyway, lets let bygones be bygones. &lt;br/&gt;Its true people drift apart, but it has been a special time in IIT meeting so many brilliant people. I dont know how other colleges are, but I think IIT experience is unique in itself. &lt;br/&gt;I am going to post a response to this post on my blog. Check it out when its up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I took that course by Dilip too, and it was an extremely enjoyable course. The best part of the course was the hours I spent in his room after the classes, talking about what-nots and excerpts from his immense library. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He&#039;s a most interesting person to speak with, especially about religion and history.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nicely written. Don&#039;t worry too much about friends and meeting up. I feel the time spent apart is really useful. It is such a joy to meet them after long periods of time, I can hardly find another more awesome feeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PSU is a very nice place. You&#039;ll have fun there. Good luck.]]></description>
