					<description><![CDATA[Hi coolshankin,
I  read ur trip log to the Kalihani pass. Was just amazing primarily due to the fact that the Himalayas are awesome and very few people trek over there. So the fewer people who trek there are simply amazing. I am aalso a die hard trekker and have done various treks in the Himalayas and am planning to do the same trek in June with the same operator as yours, Kaushal Desai. So just needed a few pointers from ur side.
1) Is Kaushal gud enough
2) Money that he charged per person
3) Total no. of days ( Manali to Manali)
4) Detailed day wise itinerary, if u can mail me

Thanks
Lakshit]]></description>
