					<description><![CDATA[@coolshankin&lt;br/&gt;Nice observation. Although doesn&#039;t apply to me in general since I strive to be different. However, the reading a book to boast about it in order to score brownie points is very true and a subtle observation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Batman being gay, I wouldn&#039;t know . &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R S]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice man... short post for once... still i was busy and could finish reading it now...&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, i think that the i am with famous syndrome is more in the younger days when we are insecure about ourselves, we do not know if we in our own form and natural personality are acceptable and &quot;good&quot; and all that and we like to emulate and stick around someone whose personality has been accepted.&lt;br/&gt;I think a mature adult mind does not feel an urge to be with a famous person, of course some insecurity lingers on for all life and it may lead to that as well.&lt;br/&gt;Pretty ridiculous theory of being with famous with god(no capitals-blasphemy!) as the famous person. I do not think that applies, because people believe in god for strength and resolve.&lt;br/&gt;Then again i would mention that sidekick may not necessarily have a low self esteem or the tendency to be with famous either, i think robin is with batman because he likes what batman does or then again he might &quot;like&quot; batman.&lt;br/&gt;Interesting post man.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Apt for the current situation - hype of shivaji. Strange to see that the movie is off the reels even before anyone saw it and commented abt it. People are flocking at the theathers even on the first day. They are the hero side-kicks now. People tend to emulate a hero when they are out of theather,they tend to get involved in the movie and his stunts. The more famous the hero, the more the involvement in the movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Truly this behaviour is found in many fields like movies,acads,sports,religion etc. And as you have pointed out, I always found it very funny ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First things First! BATMAN AND GAY!!!&lt;br/&gt;Come on! He is the epitome of manliness if you ask me. A cool, black car; hi-tech devices, and extremely cold and unemotional. HOW IS HE GAY!!! Robin, I agree. He wears a red shirt, with a yellow cape and a  light green over-under-wear. He has to be gay. Not that there is anything wrong with it!&lt;br/&gt;Other than that, brilliant post. God is the Hero and we are side-kicks!!! TOTAL CRACK! Are we seeing swani-shankin in the future?]]></description>
