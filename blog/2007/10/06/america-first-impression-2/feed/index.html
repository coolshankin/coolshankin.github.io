					<description><![CDATA[heya!
Finally decided to comment..I found both ur recent blogs on the first impressions very interesting. very observant, informative and some were expected outta the country I have always closely watched. No special liking but its sudden rise always intrigued me. One thing, I respect the huge amount of variety of people the country offers. I thought nothing beat India but USA does reach upto it. A really nice observation on the coins and road signs..wonder how you remember them and type them all..It reminds me of al those small thoughts I have when I walk by such stuff...Veteran Blogger Mind I guess!
Glad to see the place offers you an interesting environment worth blogging..I am getting late right now..need to get back soon as its raining again in Bangalore and this place suddenly cant afford it!
Ciao! n hey Happy Birthday!   :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, your impressiosn are same as mine. To be honest, its been pretty much as i expected. People do work hard during the week and party in the weekends. I think that is a good system. I was watching the 20-20 finals in the mech computer lab, and everyone around me was studying.... Most of them undergrads. I dont remember studying on a monday morning in any of my undergrad sems. But then, i wont know how many were not studying. Univs here are huge! maybe im seeing the number and not the percentage. Only draw back, i couldnt jump up and shout when India won!
One thing that caught me off-gaurd is that there is just too much work load here. Mine is a quarter system and so its worse. I am dying here!]]></description>
