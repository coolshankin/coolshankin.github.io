					<description><![CDATA[oye! Vadas are made in my house dipped in sugar (Yeah thats pretty weird!) on some festivals. Donut and sometimes saucer..whichever..not much thought laid. I&#039;m a gult and havent heard of such traditions here.

Besides now being in Chennai..I see there are ALL kinds of vadas all over the place. No occasions needed.

Onions and garlic arent used. As usage of and eating anything that is grown below ground is against the Brahmin culture on a good day. But tomato..That is not avoided.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The allusion is to the &quot;connects&quot; in Freakonomics, so I think the title isn&#039;t inappropriate.
Mafia/Wolf - Maro put me fundaes about the game on the day of Lehmann workshop (when they had organized a &#039;trading game&#039;). It is indeed very deep! It&#039;s a sad thing junta go ga-ga over CS :(]]></description>
