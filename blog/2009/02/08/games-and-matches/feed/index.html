					<description><![CDATA[@manohar

yeah ... that also explains why ipl is so populat and icl is not .... just what the media bring out.

would you consider chess a sport? even if it is a  sport, only tennis seems to be popular when it comes to individual representation.  you are not representing your nation in tennis or chess (mostly). thats probably why not many follow individual sport. tennis is an exception, maybe because, media highlights it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s actually a combination of all you said da. But u have missed out the role of media and campaigning. That will again lead us to the question does media show what we want or do we see what media shows......

Hockey for eg : with so much last minute action has a lot of scope for TV viewing but due to all non-sports problems it has no takers.

Btw, India are now OK types in hockey da. We lost to Holland 2-1 in Punjab Gold cup final yesterday :-(

And what about games like Chess etc, will anybody ever &quot;follow&quot;them ??
:-). I wouldn&#039;t follow it even if my own son was in it :-)

May be following is only for Junta sports, which can entertain the viewer]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@random f***
yes i am back! no f word, this post might get blocked in some places because of that :P

@v
well, you are an exception. but man! u rock! :P

@mahesh
penn state just went through a bad phase. it&#039;s ok ... this time you lost to good teams. you will survive :)

@anuj
not sure if you read the post completely. my point was we do see empty stands in domestic cricket in india. but in US college football has 100,000 fan in the stadium. no bidy in india cares about a match between two colleges.

@vignesh
thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A reasonable analysis of why and how people get hooked on to sports. There&#039;s one point I disagree with though. 
Interest in a particular team / sport is not just about how much one is bombarded with it or how heavy the schedule is. I follow the EPL and support a particular team because I identify with the ethos, habits and tradition associated with that particular club. Even during the international breaks that happen once every few months or the off-season, I follow the happenings at my club. 
Perhaps your reasoning applies to some sects of followers, but is slightly demeaning to some seasoned supporters! :)]]></description>
