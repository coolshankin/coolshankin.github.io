										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I argue that the system of meritocratic inheritance of technology coupled with economies of scale is a possible reason for income inequality, and I provide a philosophical justification for a universal basic income in the current system.</em></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The political discourse about income inequality and universal basic income (UBI) has revolved around the idea of fairness in a free market system. On the left, a high income inequality is seen as a symptom of an unjust system that rewards a few, and a UBI is seen as a restoring act that ensures that no one is left behind. On the right, a high income inequality is seen as incentivizing hard work, and a UBI, at best, is seen as an anti-coercion agent that can prevent exploitation. Today&#8217;s high income inequality has been partly blamed on educational disparity. The economic productivity of educated individuals is extremely high, and thus, they command proportionally high incomes. I will argue that the high productivity is not entirely due to the chosen individuals&#8217; hard work and intellect. A substantial portion of the productivity is inherited from scientific advances made by people before us. I believe that such an inheritance ought to be distributed &#8220;fairly&#8221; and that the exiting system has failed to account for it. Therefore, I argue that a UBI may have a philosophical justification.</p>
<p><strong>Statistics About Income Distribution</strong></p>
<p>Meritocracy has driven the evolution of ideas about distributive justice for a long time. It is apparent that our social, political, and economic systems have heeded this call. The richest people in the world are mostly those who lead state-of-the-art industries, and those who have inherited their wealth are small in number (<a title="Business Insider's look into billionairs" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/richest-people-in-the-world-2015-4">link</a>). Even in the general population, studies have shown (<a title="An excerpt of a book in The Atlantic" href=" https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/why-workers-are-losing-the-war-against-machines/247278/ ">link</a>; see figure 3.5) that the expected income increases with higher qualifications. It might be tempting to welcome such a trend as it incentivizes people to be highly educated and, consequently, more productive. This point of view, however, assumes that productivity of an individual is proportional their industriousness and intellect. A closer inspection reveals that they are only weakly related, and the lack of a strong relation is a result of selective technological inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>Studies in Economics</strong></p>
<p>Nobel Laureate Robert Solow (<a title="wiki article" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Solow">link</a>) and Trevor Swan (<a title="wiki article" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Swan">link</a>) developed an economic model (<a title="The Solow-Swan model" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow-Swan_model ">link</a>) to study the long term growth of economies. Using their mathematical model, they concluded that about 80-90% of productivity growth is a direct result of cumulative technological progress, not industriousness or intellect. Even a &#8220;rival&#8221; model (<a title="Endogenous growth model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_growth_theory ">link</a>) attributes our economic growth to technological progress.</p>
<p>In their book, Unjust Desserts (<a title="Amazon link" href=" https://www.amazon.com/Unjust-Deserts-Taking-Common-Inheritance/dp/1595584021 ">link</a>), the authors have studied this phenomenon and have provided a detailed analysis of technological progress and its implication on income and wealth distribution. One of the authors&#8217; blog post (<a title="A Medium blog post" href="https://medium.com/economicsecproj/technological-inheritance-and-the-case-for-a-basic-income-ded373a69c8e">link</a>) provides identical arguments as this post, and a talk (<a title="Youtube link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINVk8G1T3U">link</a>) by the other author makes the same case. They provide numerous examples to embolden their case, and I will add more below.</p>
<p><strong>Anecdotal Examples</strong></p>
<p>At the industry level, the CEO pay has increased ten fold in the last thirty-forty years (<a title="Economic Policy Institute" href="http://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-has-grown-90-times-faster-than-typical-worker-pay-since-1978/">link</a>). Is this because the CEOs of today are ten times more productive? Or is it because the companies today are ten times more productive? It is likely the latter, and the reason for the high productivity of industries today is the technological growth in the last few decades. The CEOs are only partly responsible for the growth, but they are paid as if they are solely responsible for the growth. Even among companies today, those who are at the top of the technology &#8220;food chain&#8221; seem more profitable on a per man-hour basis. Although the data is not very conclusive (<a title="Business Insider article" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/top-tech-companies-revenue-per-employee-2015-10/#12-ibm-244447-per-employee-1">link</a> , <a title="Business Insider article" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/top-tech-companies-revenue-per-employee-2015-10/#12-ibm-244447-per-employee-1">link</a>)<wbr />, the trend is noticeable. Qualcomm consumes ATT&#8217;s products, and Qualcomm is more profitable than ATT.  In turn, Samsung consumes Qualcomm&#8217;s product, Android (Alphabet) consumes Samsung&#8217;s products, and Angry Birds consumes Android&#8217;s product. The per-man-hour revenue for these companies are strongly linked to their place in the technological food chain (or network) and how much they inherit.</p>
<p>At an individual level, for instance, the inventors of fast Fourier transform made less money than someone who simply uses it today. A broadway actor makes more than a movie actor. A software engineer earns more than someone in the service industry. These facts about individual incomes are not accidental. They are directly correlated to how strongly individuals leverage technology to be highly productive, i.e., to reach more customers, viewers, or clients. For instance, a movie actor, unlike a broadway actor, can simultaneously perform in front of millions of people. I should emphasize that knowing how to leverage technology is a skill that needs to be proportionally rewarded. Our system, however, rewards groups of individuals disproportionately by being oblivious to what was inherited or leveraged. A natural question arises: how should people be rewarded?</p>
<p><strong>Political Philosophy, Fairness and Free Market</strong></p>
<p>Political philosophy has handled this question about a fair compensation for more than two millennia. Many would agree that a &#8220;fair&#8221; system should satisfy a couple of objectives: a) it should pay more for a harder (intellectually or physically) task, and  b) it should pay more if you are more &#8220;productive&#8221;. One can argue in favour of a free market system because the compensation is a function of the supply and demand, which satisfies both the objectives.</p>
<p>In theory, the supply of labour for the task is indicative of how hard the task is; greater the supply, easier the task. If a technology may be easily inherited, there will be a greater supply of workers, engineer, or doctors, so their compensation will be correspondingly lower. In theory, a demand for the product is indicative of the how productive one is after the task is completed; greater the demand, more productive one can claim to be. In tandem, one can argue that a free market system leads to a fair outcome. In fact, one can further argue that it incentives higher efficiency because it is oblivious to the means of production.</p>
<p>In practice, however, does the supply of more and more industries and workers correct the advantages of selective technological inheritance? No, It does not seem so (going by the data above). The likely reason for this is that the economies of scale (<a title="wiki article" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale ">link</a>) is at odds with greater competition. There is also a high barrier to enter an industry due to the technical know-how involved. Those who get to lead established and newer industries will be rewarded for all the productivity, and the reward will be oblivious to inheritance. The tree analogy below provides a simple (though not a complete) explanation.</p>
<p><strong>The Tree Analogy</strong></p>
<p>Our technological progress is like a tree that been grown for generations together. Those who know how to climb the tree deserve more fruits than those who do not. But do they deserve all the fruits? No! Yet, our system rewards the few people at the top as if they are responsible for the growth of the tree because they have the access to the fruits. Training more climbers (more competing industries) might mitigate or eliminate the income disparity issue, but the system&#8217;s fundamental issues of economies of scale, high entry barrier, and obliviousness to inheritance remain.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Basic Income</strong></p>
<p>I have argued that our wealth is mostly an inheritance from the people who came before us. Although the current system is meritocratic, it fails to account for the fact that our productivity is mostly an inheritance. While it is important that we have to ensure that people have to be incentivized to work hard and carry on the progress, it is also important to fairly distribute the inheritance. A UBI is an excellent way to satisfy both the objectives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a response to Swaminomic&#8217;s post, where he talks about economic inequality in Indian states (<a title="Don’t worry about inequality" href="http://swaminomics.org/?p=1990" target="_blank">link</a>). I will briefly present his views first and then present some flaws in his argument by providing some facts.</p>
<p>He suggests that India should not be worrying about economic inequality as much as worrying about the overall growth because actions to promote overall growth will benefit a state more than just targeting inequality. He argues that according to Gini Coefficient (<a title="Wiki link: Gini Coefficient" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient" target="_blank">link</a>), which measures economic inequality in a region, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, and Gujarat are the most unequal states, but the same set of states are more prosperous than the rest of the country. Thus, he concludes that inequality is not a good measure to assess the well-being of Indian states. He implies that the Gini coefficient is meaningless because overall growth brings more people into a prosperous state and skews the wealth distribution. And also, because of the presence of rich folks in Gurgaon, a fairly secure landlord in Haryana is counted as poor in the Gini Coefficient. The wiki article on the Gini Coefficient (<a title="Wiki link: Gini coefficient" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient" target="_blank">link</a>)  discusses the weaknesses in the measure. Swaminomic&#8217;s post says that some of the weaknesses are applicable in India&#8217;s case.</p>
<p>Against the harsh reality of farmer suicides, I am led to believe that the weakness do not play a  role. This presentation (<a title="Farmer Suicide in India: On UN's site" href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd16/PF/presentations/farmers_relief.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>) and this wiki article (<a title="Wiki link: Farmer Suicides in India" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_suicides_in_India" target="_blank">link</a>) indicate that Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra and Punjab see some of the highest cases farmer suicides in the country. The claim that the inequality measure falsely indicates a fairly-rich person as a poor because the presence of richer folks is untrue in these cases. Inequality and poverty are very real in this case. Clearly, spending effort on the overall health has not benefited the very poor. Inequality needs as much attention as the overall economic health. A disguised trickle-down-theory (tried, tested and failed) argument will not convince me.</p>
<p>I do realise that the farmer&#8217;s suicide is an incomplete indicator. I am willing to look at other indicators if any of you can provide them. Given an agriculture-based rural economy, farmers form a major chunk of the population. So I think it would be hard to find indicators that support the contrary. The post says that GDP is an incomplete indicator, but it uses GDP to make arguments against Gini coefficient as an indicator (I assume. If not, then what?). There is a structural flaw in the argument, too. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I came across a blog post (<a title="What Can Onions Teach Us About Oil Prices?" href="http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2011/05/what-can-onions-teach-us-about-oil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>, and also a column: <a title="Gasoline and Onions" href="http://townhall.com/columnists/johnstossel/2011/05/04/gasoline_and_onions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>) that talks about the effects of futures market on the oil and onion market. Many think that futures market is responsible for the oil price fluctuation (<a title="Bernie Sanders Demands Action From Obama On Wall Street Oil 'Gambling'" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/29/bernie-sanders-demands-ac_n_855495.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>). The author notes that despite the absence of futures market in the onion markets (due to Onion Future Act (<a title="Wiki: Onion Future Act" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_Futures_Act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>)), the price fluctuations are more severe than that is seen in oil trading. The authors uses this example to argue some academics&#8217; belief that futures markets control extreme price swings. I think the analysis is poor for the reasons I describe below. I am not an economist; but, being trained as an engineer, I can say that their analysis is flawed.</p>
<p>First, the statistical analysis of price fluctuations in the posts is poor. The author of the blog post compares the monthly changes in the price of onion to that of oil. We have seen that oil prices have a two- or three-year cycle. Obviously, the monthly changes in oil prices is not as big as the changes in onion prices. A better statistical analysis is needed. Also, volatility of onion prices before and after the Onion Futures Act was passed is open to debate (<a title="Wiki: Onion Futures Act" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_Futures_Act#Effect_on_price_volatility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>).</p>
<p>Second,  it is not a controlled statistical sampling of commodity value because there are a number of factors that affect each the price of commodity. The oil market has a seasonal supply-and-demand cycle, whereas the onion market experiences abrupt supply issues due to inclimate weather. There are plenty of other factors, including the price of oil, that determines the price of onions. Oil prices are globally uniform while onion price vary geographically. Future trading is not the only factor that differs between the two markets.</p>
<p>Third, if the cycle is two to three years long, ten-year data of oil prices fluctuation is not enough to statistically conclude anything about futures trading. We either need a different form of analysis for the data from the limited time period or need data from a larger time period. But it is hard to control all the factors when the time period is large. Thus, statistical analysis would likely be meaningless.</p>
<p>The authors may be right about their conclusion, but they have not provided sound evidence to back it up.<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some claim that the expiration of Bush Tax Cuts, only for the rich, is class warfare, and that it punishes the rich for working hard. The argument implicitly assumes that regardless of who you are, being smart and working hard helps you grow richer. I decided to put that claim to test because we have mostly seen children of poor parents grow up to be poor and children of the rich grow up to be rich (for a number of reasons). I wondered what statistical evidence is needed to conclude with the claim. After some time, I was able to conceptualise the survey that can statistically &#8220;prove&#8221; the claim. I googled and found out that such surveys have been done. They have proved me right, i.e., how rich you will be depends strongly on how rich your parent were (there are exceptions, of course). In this post, I will explain the survey data that is needed to make any such claim and also suggest ways to strengthen the claim.</p>
<p><strong>Wealth Mobility</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Wealth mobility&#8221; is an economist&#8217;s term for inter-generational movement on the economic ladder, which studies how one&#8217;s wealth is related to their parents&#8217;. Studies on wealth mobility (<a title="Wealth mobility and race (PDF link)" href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~dc66/wealth_mobility.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>, <a title="Wealth mobility in the US" href="http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=35&amp;articleid=85&amp;sectionid=513" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>, <a title="Wealth mobility (I don't have access to this)" href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/003465397750160167?journalCode=rest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>) begin by categorising the parents on percentile-based income brackets, i.e., determine what percentage of people were richer than the parents in question, adjusted for inflation. Some are in top 10%, few more in top 10%-20%, more in top 20%-30%, and so on. The study also looks at the income brackets of their children. Thus, we get a table of numbers which conveys how many children, whose parents were in, say, top 10%-20% bracket, stay in the top 10-20% bracket, how many have moved to the top 10% bracket, how many to the 20%-30% bracket, and so on. We may call this &#8216;wealth-mobility table.&#8217;</p>
<p>If there is an even distribution of people moving across the income brackets, I will conclude that luck does not play a big role in being rich (for most people). If the results are skewed to show that rich children stay rich and poor children stay poor, I will conclude that luck does plays a big role and taxing the rich more is not all that unfair.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>The studies (linked above) have concluded that upward mobility is hard, but possible. Most people stay in the same bracket as their parents did. I don&#8217;t think this is surprising because opportunities are plenty for the rich, while lacking for the poor. Thus, I wouldn&#8217;t call higher tax rate on the rich as class warfare.</p>
<p><strong>Inequality Fractal</strong></p>
<p>There is a small flaw in the studies linked above. They do not consider the fact that economic inequality is a fractal (<a title="Chris Hayes on fractal inequality" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/01/31/chris-hayes-on-fractal-inequality-at-davos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>). Wealth is exponentially distributed in many countries. Top 0.1% of people are much more richer than top 1%, who are much more richer than top 10%, and so on (<a title="United State of Inequality (by Timothy Noah in Slate)" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2266025/entry/2266026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>). Thus, a person from any income range will find people who are 10 to 100 times poorer and people who are 10 to 100 times richer. This inequality fractal makes the studies&#8217; linearly-distributed income brackets (Top 10%, 10-20%, 20-30% and so on) inappropriate. Better-designed income brackets will strengthen any conclusions that are drawn from the data.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Results*</strong></p>
<p>We expect a wealth barrier beyond which good wealth mobility is present among the rich. The rich and the super-rich children, both, have equal access to education and other opportunities. There are plenty of avenues to grow richer and plenty of risk of losing money. A dynamic equilibrium can be expected at the top. Note that there may not be just one barrier; there may be several barriers as we move down the income ladder depending of government policies.</p>
<p>Technology is know to be detrimental factor in economic inequality (<a title="Technology, not globalisation, feeds income inequality: Wall Street Journal" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/07/24/technology-not-globalization-feeds-income-inequality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>), i.e., it has widen the gap between haves and have-nots. But at the same time, we expect technology to move the wealth barrier towards the poorer side as technology makes in easier for everyone to avail education and other opportunities. In the next generation, technology may alleviate the economic inequality.</p>
