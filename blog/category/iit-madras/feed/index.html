										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In its recent decision, IIT Madras has decided that students in their third years of engineering may complete their internship requirement at Indian &#8220;core&#8221; industries only (via vatsap). This rules out students who are interested in research to do their internship in universities in India or abroad. There are many students who are not happy with the rule and have clearly expressed their anger in IITM Squirrel mail.Let me justify why this rule doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>Firstly, IIT Madras is a deemed institution and can take any decision it wants. I am not here to contest that. On the outside, this rules does make sense. We are given a degree in a specific branch of engineering, and are expected to meet certain standards set by the institute in order to get one. Exposure to Industry is one of them. And since it is &#8220;mechanical&#8221; engieering, &#8220;electrical&#8221; or &#8220;aerospace&#8221; engineering, we need exposure to the respective &#8220;core&#8221; industry. Dig a little deeper and the reasoning is flawed in academic interest.<br />
<strong><br />
&#8220;Core&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Few months back, I remember reading an article my Richard Dawkins on thinking in groups or categories and drawing lines between them. He talks about evolution saying there is little difference between humans and non humans but we have different set of &#8220;moral&#8221; rules for human and non-humans. This imaginary line that we draw, between humans and non-humans or different branches in engineering, is quite unhealthy. We ought to learn to see them as a range rather than categorize them into different branches. Entire stream of engineering is held together by mathematics. What we learn in a given field is applicable in the whole spectrum of branches. What we learn in Atmospheric modelling can very well be used by a business analyst in stock market prediction or in signal processing by an electrical engineer. If the institution is trying to confine the knowledge of its students to their &#8220;core&#8221; branches alone, growt beyond boundaries is impossible. As such, we have a *lot* of core courses to deal with, lot more than any reputed school in USA. Core Industry restriction isn&#8217;t gonna be of a good help when it comes to all round development. I am unable to find that article by Dawkins. Please send me the link if you have it.</p>
<p>It is an open secret that it is the parents who choose the stream of education for their children, be it engineering, medical or law. Sometimes wrong choices are made. I know students who have not been happy with engineering and have shifted over to pure science, management or even changed branches within engineering. I myself migrated from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science. In almost every case, internships is the &#8220;new&#8221; area has helped the students. In IIT Madras itself, I have attended talks by profs who refer to other eminent prof who have explored a number of fields during their career. Their justification has simply been, &#8220;its not on my forehead that I have to be a physicist just because i have a BSc in physics&#8221;. Why is it that the same profs are trying to discourage student from venturing into new area with the core industry restriction?</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Industry&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Best research happens in universities or research labs, not in industries. India needs researchers. More the merrier. Research and development needs a push. It is these professors who often complain that student are not interested in research, and are attracted by fat pay packages by industries. I know a lot of students who would have done great in an industry but have chosen a research career out of sheer interest. Isn&#8217;t the new rule shunning students , who are interested in research, away from it???</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Indian&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>What is our obsession with being totally Indian? Shashi Tharoor had asked in TOI column about the apparent insecurity in Indians to change city name from Bombay to Mumbai etc. Is the same insecurity at play here for restriction internships to Indian Industries alone? Sharing knowledge helps, even if it&#8217;s beyond political borders. There are a number of students who have had accepted journal/conf papers from interships abroad. I am sure some students whould have carried on their work from internships to final year projects. Going abroad also means brining in ideas and knowledge. It&#8217;s not a one-way traffic. I remember out professor lamenting about not having projects by B. tech. students worthy of being recognised internationally. Well, this new rule isn&#8217;t going to help that either.</p>
<p>The purpose of an educational institute, roughly speaking, like IITs is to make a contribution in technology to the society. This &#8216;society&#8217; is not restricted to Indian society alone. Who is the best judge on how a student can make this contribution? Obviously the student himself. It must be upto the student to decide what best for him, and consequently to the society.<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Four years of hostel life changes a lot of things. Though I see myself as the same person as I was when entered IIT Madras, I kind of know that I have changes a lot in these four years. This post will reflect what I have learned from the four years of my undergraduate life. It is unfortunate that many us miss out on so many opportunities, while some of us explore a part of it. And there are very few, if any, who make the best use; I so envy them. I wanted to write this while at IIT Madras, but laziness got the better of me.</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial;">Statuary Warning : Long post </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial;">The Tech. Part</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It was only in my final year that I indulged myself in the robotics, robotics-like activities because the courses I took demanded them. My college has a fairly active &#8220;hobby club&#8221; which caters to people with such interests. In fact, the robotics club started in my first year. It now provides a reasonably good platform for the students to start their work. What many of us fail to realize is that when you get your hands down and dirty, science and technology can be fun too. In the final semester, I was involved with a project where a miniature model of a lift had to be made. To be frank, it was the first time that I actually learned about handling micro processors, assembling mechanical components and electrical components together and actually put some of the workshop skills to use. The best part of the whole deal is the fact the you get to know people better, you interact with lot more and make more acquaintances. I can only wonder why I chose to distance myself from such activities in the past<span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">After the first year, it was only a matter of time before many more clubs like Physics clubs, Astronomy club </span><span style="font-family: arial;">popped up. I am sure that those involved in their functioning would have had loads of fun. Mostly, I was part of the Programming team in IIT Madras in four years. It was amazing being part of that. Met awesome team mates</span> <span style="font-family: arial;">and that even <a style="color: #3333ff;" href="http://coolshankin.blogspot.com/2007/03/postcards-from-tokyo-and-kuala-lumpur.html">took me</a> to Tokyo. As part of the technical festival called &#8216;Shaastra&#8217;, projects such as building a hovercraft, <a style="color: #3333ff;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity">tensegrity tower</a>, remote controlled aircraft etc would have been an immense learning experience. Yet again I stress the fact that it is the people who you meet during the period that you value the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Management Part</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Many people miss out on being volunteers and coordinators for different events and facilities that help massive cultural and technical festivals (Saarang and Shaastra respectively) run smoothly. It is a common misconception among students that by being a part of mangement, the &#8220;fun&#8221; of Saarang and Shaastra is gone. That is true only to an limited extent. Given the ample number of events that take place, and given that fact that there are only a handful of event which really confined to your interests, you are not missing out much. Work on Saarang and Shaastra begins months before the actual event. During the run-up when you are loaded with tonnes of work other than acads, it is very satisfying targets falling one by one during the entire course. It is a pity that many of us take academics so seriously that it is considered a &#8216;waste-of-time&#8217; to find yourself doing &#8220;other&#8221; things. </span></p>
<p>I have been a &#8216;volunteer&#8217; three times and a &#8216;coordinator&#8217; five times. Each time, I have had great fun being a part of both technical and cultural festivals. More than half the people I know in IITM can be traced back to acquaintances I made as part of the organizing team. In 2006 Saarang, I was part of the Production team which ended up being a great group to hang out with. After that, I was part of the event &#8220;how things work&#8221; for Mechanical Engineering Department&#8217;s technical festival &#8216;mechanica&#8217;. I was forced into it, but I have to thank all those who forced me into it because the people I got to know were the most enthusiastic bunch I had ever seen. Also because, I managed to win &#8220;how things work&#8221; in the following shaastra. In other occasions too, I have always loved being responsible for whatever I was in-charge of. Any youngster today, I would advice him to be both technically inclined as well as be ready to work on cultural activities to earn a wholesome experience. Plus, a coordinator in Shaastra would mean 400 bucks worth of freebies and 900 bucks in Saarang <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>It is often complained that students more time of computer these day and less on social interations. I think more such activities undertaken by the institute will help in building Social interation skills among students. Instead, today we find the Dean reducing the number of days of Saarang as it not in academic interest. Earlier, a real show-case of Indian Culture was observed in the name of &#8220;Bharath Utsav&#8221; in IIT Madras. Again, as it was not a part of academics, the entire fest was canceled six years ago.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Acad. Part</span></p>
<p>In the final semester I took a course named &#8220;technology and development&#8221; taught by <a style="color: #3333ff;" href="http://www.hss.iitm.ac.in/people/faculty/veeraraghavan.html">Prof. D Veeraraghavan</a> one of the most eminent profs in Humanities Department in IIT Madras. In one of the classes, an old student of his, an alumnus of my college&#8217;s electrical department, gave a small talk. He had done is Ph.D. in social sciences unlike his peers who stayed on in core engineering. That talk was an eye-opener for me on research in Social Sciences. He explained about indigenous cotton seeds, imported cotton seeds and how it affected the rural textile industry as the looms were designed for indigenous harder cotton seeds. Frankly, until then, though I had often wondered, I had no clue as to research in subjects other than science and technology. It is true that IITs (and all engineering colleges for that matter) provide a one dimensional view of education, ie technology. A &#8220;full-fledged&#8221; engineer from my college will have completed just 12 of 180 credits in non-engineering subjects. This is a dismally low number. It is sad that people don&#8217;t realize this.</p>
<p>Apart from numerous (a <span style="font-style: italic;">lot</span> more than even MIT actually) core engineering courses, we are given a free choice for two courses (free electives) from any department. Also, we several have a minor streams which are designed to different from our engineering Major. In my opinion, these options aren&#8217;t enough. But, many fail to consolidate even on this limited choice. For instance, almost three-fourth of computer science students opt for operation research as minor as it complements some of their courses. Though I appreciate their enthusiasm, I have to remind them that the whole point of minor stream is to do something different from the regular routine. A lot of students end up taking courses from their own department in the &#8216;free-elective&#8217; slot. They are simply not making the most of what the institution has to offer.</p>
<p>I should refer to Steve Jobs speech in Stanford convocation where he talks about &#8220;connecting the dots&#8221; on his calligraphy course which he later used in Apple mac OS(<a style="color: #3333ff;" href="http://www.youtube.com/?v=D1R-jKKp3NA">youtube link</a><a style="color: #3333ff;" href="http://www.youtube.com/?v=D1R-jKKp3NA">,</a> <a style="color: #3333ff;" href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">text link</a>). I would advise any fresher to explore his options completely before resorting to &#8220;safe&#8221; choice of following the herd.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The get-together, treks part</span></p>
<p>This is one part, where, I don&#8217;t think many would have missed out. I have been to places in last two years of stay. Traveling, photography are cherished by all. It is inevitable that people end up in a clique of 5-6 people who constantly hangout together. It is in treks and traveling that people with common friends get together and have the time of their lives. The network of friends grows very fast on such occasions. Hopefully, I will go to one more Himalayan trek that is being planned now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> When you travel, invariably, you have stories to bring back and envy a lot of people.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The treats part</span></p>
<p>Chennai, though the climate sucks, is blessed with beaches. The treats, get-together, parties happen a lot across the east coast. When it comes to choosing colleges for your under graduation, I would recommend a place on the coast, a big city preferably. A city a lots to offer. Chennai, for instance, has places like Tanjarine (sizzlers), Don Pepe(mexican), Eatalica (Italian-American), Pupil (formerly Veronas, Junk food heaven), Buena Vista (on East coast road, for secluded beach with nice stuff <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ), New Yorkers, Lil Italy etc. It&#8217;s no use lamenting about the city not being as &#8220;cool&#8221; as Bangalore (in every sense), enjoy the place while you are there. Make sure you visit all the eat-out places</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The LAN part</span></p>
<p>Gaming, surfing, movies on comps, sitcoms etc form a integral part of any hostel life when it is connect to LAN and internet. You gotta enjoy all of that while it lasts. When you watch movies in CFD lab meant for academic purposes late in the night because of the AC to beat the summer heat, the experience will remain imprinted in your mind for a long time.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Be tech savvy, be geeky, be cool, have fun! </span>Believe me! All of them can happen at the same time</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">On a personal note:</span></p>
<p>I am headed to Pennsylvania State University (PSU) for Ph.D. in scientific computing in Computer Science and Engineering Department. I am sure I will miss the name &#8216;coolshankin&#8217; three months on, though i hate it as of now. Many of my friends have told me that all I have to do to tell them my email address and the name will stick. If that happens, I will surely hate the name all over again. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I am sure a lot of people will hate me for saying this, but I will say it anyway. When people have no reason to meet, they don&#8217;t. Though we all promise that we will keep in touch, it is only once in a while that we actually bother to mail the friends. When there is a reunion, there simply isn&#8217;t any common topic to talk about. The conversations are mostly formal. Given orkut, facebook and gtalk, I am sure people will make an attempt to keep in touch. After convocation, I got no idea when I will be meeting my friends again. Perhaps in US or perhaps in India itself after one, one and a half or two years. By then, all of us would have moved on and meeting over the net will also be a rare thing.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It is a fact that though we all keep promising that we will keep in touch, in the end we all tend lose touch. To know whats happening with my life, you can always see my <a style="color: #3333ff;" href="http://coolshankin.blogspot.com/2006/07/whats-your-status-today.html">status messages</a> and read my blog posts <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> :P. After a lot of complaints from friends and family alike, I promise to take more pictures with myself in it and post them at flickr, orkut, picassa or wherever. It was great knowing you all</span></p>
<p>I am reminded of a song by Amy Grant which goes, &#8220;Oh how the years go by, oh how the love brings tears to my eyes &#8230;.&#8221; It&#8217;s very apt here. Don&#8217;t mind the video .. listen to the song.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZcbRr7GBHY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p>I remember my first day at the college when my dad was about to leave me and I was missing home already. I was thinking, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this is happening&#8221;. Couple of days back, when I was packing stuff in my room to leave home I was thinking again, &#8220;<span style="font-family: arial;">I can&#8217;t believe this is happening.&#8221; Emotions were exactly the same. How good a place can be measured by how happy you are while you were at the place. </span><span style="font-family: arial;">How good a place can be measured by how sad you felt when you left the place. I think the latter is more appropriate. Lemme know what you think.</span><!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify&gt;&lt;span style=;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update 2:@everyone .. about the bussiness analyst question</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The reply he got was an arrogant &#8220;you are not suppose to ask me questions, I am suppose to&#8221;. Would a little reverence to students hurt?</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span><br />
all i am against is arrogance of the interviewer. yes, the candidate must have done his homework.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span><span style="font-style: italic;"><br />
&#8220;they should be well aware that none of engineering students have any clue of what business analyst is&#8221; </span>etc are suposrting statement meant to justify that the interveiwer should not have been so surprized that he had to resort to the arrogance.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span></p>
<p>To my friends who have been placed in companies mentioned here, please don&#8217;t get offended. I just thought speaking out against it will change things for better next time around. The first session of placements in IIT Madras comes to an end today. There is a break for about two weeks for the inter-IIT sports meet after which they resume once again. I was disappointed by the lack of professionalism by some of the highly regarded companies here during the last two weeks. In fact, the unprofessional display was unexpected by some of the companies that had come for pre-placement talks (ppt) over the semester. There those handful of companies which refused to reveal their compensation packages even when the questions about it was raised during the question answer session. A mere hand waving &#8220;competitive package&#8221; was announced by them. It annoying when that the one thing many look for in a ppt (yeah, it&#8217;s the money.. who cares about job satisfaction and social life anyway <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). This disregard to professionalism was shown by relatively unknown firms.<span style="font-family: arial;">It was during the placement week that many of the renowned companies also let us down. It all began with Deutche Bank. Citing reasons of being unavailable during the first week of December, they were allowed to come for placement well ahead of the scheduled placement week. As it was one of the high paying jobs, no one complained. The shortlist was announced and interviews were scheduled at Park Shereton hotel. One of my friends, <a href="http://ashishgandhe.blogspot.com">Ashish</a>, who was short listed was interviewed. Being from an engineering background, non of us knew what exactly a &#8216;business analyst&#8217; was all about. During the interview, he asked them what a business analyst exactly does. The reply he got was an arrogant &#8220;you are not suppose to ask me questions, I am suppose to&#8221;. Would a little reverence to students hurt? They should be well aware that none of engineering students have any clue of what business analyst is. Their unprofessonalism (if there is such a word) doesn&#8217;t end here. They shortlist three candidates to the final interview and have given the offer to only one student among them. The other two students still are unclear whether Deutche Bank is hiring them or not. Its already been over three weeks since the interviews. The students have had a few telephonic interviews. They offered them summer internship before joining the bank as a full time employee based on their performance. Even that isn&#8217;t clear yet. From what I hear, Assistant registrar in charge of placements is very much pained by Deutche Bank. Also, The interviews stated at about 4 in the afternoon and went on till 12 in the night. They did not have the courtesy to offer at least the three students some snacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Shell was another company I was unhappy with. They came it with the offer of placements to all branches here. They asked all the interested candidates to fill in their online application form which easily took all of us 1 hour to fill. This was in the middle of the semester. After all this, they shortlist only the students from chemical and mechanical engineering. It not about the one hour that every one wasted, but about the communication gap between HR and Technical group which let us down. An internationally known company shouldn&#8217;t so crass in its approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">As my friend informs me, Fair Isaac cheated IIT Madras&#8217; placement office. It was agreed upon that those who cleared the prelim examination and appeared for test for r and d division will also be considered for other divisions. But, those who had cleared the first round of test but not the r and d round weren&#8217;t even short listed for other divisions. When one makes such a small promise, why is it hard to keep them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Yet another company was transocean. Two were almost offered jobs and other two waitlisted. During one the placement days, all four of them were flown to Bombay for interviews. As it turned out, it was a mere formality. The two were given the appointment letter, the other two were rejected. If the decision was already made here, why were the other two flown to Bombay (one of them is my room neighbour btw) missing a whole day of placements here? All they did was simply take away the chance finding a job the next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I don’t know about other (if any) unprofessionalism displayed here. But from where I see it, most of them were easily avoidable. If employers expect respect from employees, there is nothing wrong in employees expecting the same from the employers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I am off on a week of travel (no sight seeing unfortunately <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) for couple of programming contest Friday: Chennai &#8211; Delhi, Friday / Saturday Delhi &#8211; Kanpur, Sunday / Monday Kanpur &#8211; Delhi, Monday Delhi &#8211; Chennai, Tuesday / Wednesday Chennai &#8211; Bangalore, Friday / Saturday Bangalore &#8211; Coimbatore, Sunday / Monday Comibatore &#8211; Bangalore &#8230;. thursday is the only day of the week i wont be travelling at some point of time.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify&gt;&lt;span style=;">Earlier last month, there was a request made by freshies in my college about a mathematics test being postponed by a week so that it doesn’t fall right after the diwali hols. It was scheduled on Monday following the diwali weekend. Even before the request letter signed by freshies read the mathematics department, the authorities turned the request down (as far as I have been informed). In my opinion, the request was quite a legitimate one. After all, diwali is the most celebrated and biggest festival in the country. If students want to have a good time, I don’t understand their problem. I’m sure that no American or English Universities schedule their tests right after Christmas. The holiday season is what it is supposed to be &#8211; Holidays. What is annoying is the fact that it is the same authorities who complain about brain drain later at a different occasion. How the hell can’t such a simple request be fulfilled? If the “brain” is not even allowed to enjoy what rest of country takes for granted, you can’t blame them for trying to get out of this place.<span style="font-family: arial;">It is not an isolated incident that I am complaining about. We have had Industrial Design test to write on Gandhi Jayanthi. We have been forced to write Engineering Drawing Exams right after sweating it out on Fitting Workshop for four hours. There was one lab in which the in-charge wouldn’t let us switch on the fan or open the windows (it was close to 40oC) because it would affect our readings. None of us could see how though, it was a completely enclosed system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">There are always those Profs who demand respect rather than command it. Somehow the “Indian culture” put a teacher on a pedestal. From what elders have told me, “They ought to be respected, no questions asked.” Such a respect is not advised to any other profession. That leaves a little wonder why there isn’t any dignity of labour in our country. A ‘level’ of a cobbler, for instance, will remain low forever because no one ever asks anyone to respect them. But a teacher, oh no, they have to be respected. I may be grossly wrong here, but from what I see, over the ages Brahmins have been teachers and are always respected simply because they are teachers. After thousand of years, we cannot wonder how the whole social (caste) hierarchy came into existence. We are not taught to respect anyone on how well they do their job but on what they do, no matter how miserable they perform their job. Why isn’t it clear to some teachers that students are going to respect them provided they teach well, and not just because they are teachers?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Over my stay in school, every year I have seen some teachers who tried be “forgiving” to students on their birthdays. They tell them, “I am letting you go because it’s your birthday, otherwise ….” Come on! It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the birthday is effectively ruined. Thankfully, I have never been at the receiving end of this, but some of my friends were. Let me not get started on beating (read physical torture) that some of the teachers in my school were “famous” for. Also, every one of us would have been victim of imposition sometime or the other during elementary schooling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">My friends have their exams in Bangalore starting the day after Christmas. Perhaps, the authorities find Christmas and New Year parties against Indian Culture. Whatever the reason, these people (like Mathematics dept.) have forfeited their right to talk against brain-drain as such people are driving cause for brain-drain to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">And yes, before I forget, lemme tell you that Pizza and other delivery people cannot come into our campus. It is not that they cause nuisance in the campus, there are tones of other vehicles coming in and going out everyday but because it’s a residential zone. There is a gate through which the bikes don’t have go through the residential zone, and can reach all the hostels. But even that is a big deal for authorities here to allow them to come in. This issue, hopefully, will be resolved soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Please note that I am not saying many teacher, Profs and authorities are that way. In fact, I respect, in the true sense of the word, almost all teacher who have taught me, not out of compulsion but because they do a good job. There are those few who, unfortunately, make life difficult for us when all it takes is a little effort to make it simpler. And I don’t respect such people no matter what their profession is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">To end on a positive note, our Mathematics Prof had absolutely no problem in postponing the test for a week. All it took was an oral request. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">My friend, two days back, was asking us on what we look forward to this semester. We were talking about uninteresting courses we have this semester. Thanks to the administration of IITM, we have been enjoying with our LAN and Internet for about 6 months now. What the diro and other admin people have done is given us a thing or two to look forward to. It could be a movie, a song or even your project, technology has always guided us through. This time around, it has kept every one occupied. With vested potentials of LAN known to all of us, not a single minute is spared in this institute to use it to the maximum.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">If anyone has visited my profile here, you find one of my interests to be algorithm and programming. I have enthusiastically taken part on all online programming contests I have got my hand on. I use internet to look out for tougher problems and better competition. It’s wonderful for all of us to wake up every day, and think of something challenging and ponder over it for the rest of the day. Internet is always an answer to any project, any presentation or any assignment we are given.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">The story has a bitter part too. In the humanities course of mine, the free-rider attitude was talked about. It’s simply something in you that says you alone cannot bring the system down (or up). That unfortunately is problem with the LAN here. Not everybody shares files that are worth sharing, because of which all of us are losing out more entertainment. What people don’t understand here is that every individual can make LAN better. Share files, people! That’s what LAN is for.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Yet again there are other set of people who open files over LAN itself causing comps to slow down, the irritated user then stops sharing his files. This is further emptying the LAN. This is just a food for thought: the free rider’s attitude is what making </span>India<span style="font-family: arial;"> such an unclean place to live in and such a corrupt nation to be ashamed about!</span><!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">What occupies a small, but significant, part in an IIT-M ians life is making graffiti on the notices on the notice board. In an effort to be different, we call the notices IPs, standing for internal publicity. The fact remains that hardly anything we do deserves publicity, except acads of course.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">IPs fall into a set of categories like lost, lost and/but found, literary or sports events, extramural lectures and misc. As I was saying, ‘lost’ IPs usually involves losing cell phones, wallets or cycles. I am sure you would agree here that these don’t deserve publicity. IPs of ‘Lost and found’ category are rarely seen, but come with strings attached: ‘Treat expected’ Yet again, does out greed need publicity? If anything quality needs publicity, it’s honesty. That’s exactly the reason why politicians, though shameless, are popular.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">To be frank, the lit activities do set high standards here. Those standards are set by not more than ten individuals. Lit skills of an average IITMian don’t deserve publicity either. Next in the line are extramural lectures. Is it something that WE do? Obviously not.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">Misc category is better not talked about. Those are something that an average IITMian maggu doesn’t care about. Before concluding this, I must tell you that a misc IP is not ignored when the reference to grade cards is seen. IPs from NSS are keenly read by all the freshers. An innocent outsider would definitely find that the social service minded people are just the freshers, who are sure to turn anti-social in following years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">Talking about graffiti, as a fresher, the unknown destroyer was elevated to the standards much higher than any writer known. Little did we know that it gets predictable after some time, annoying after some more, chocking after a little more and inexpressible as it stand now.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">IPs that are stylish are the first targets of this destroyer. In an older blog, I had talked about how easy it is to find fault with others. This quality in all of us is easily reflected on our notice boards. Not coincidently, this is not a quality that requires special publicity. All that is done is rhyme what is written with certain anatomical parts which aren’t uttered by her majesty, the queen. I am not so sure about the king.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">All said and done, it is these IPs which brings the whole student community together. This includes (the minority) hard workers too. The jobless ones are always united. That’s the first thing we read in the morning before reading newspapers and last thing we read before dinner. A new IP is like a boring magazine, but one that is eagerly looked forward to. The destroyers continue to prey, the others continue to crib. This crib of having to read the graffiti somehow goes under publicized, while this is the only thing that requires publicity.<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Review on 20-20cricket: it is for those who find short stories too long. Hey, this is 21<sup>st</sup> century, except for me and some of the other jobless,……..sorry did I say ‘other’, …..some of the jobless people around me and of course, the person reading the blog, the universe has no time to waste. With the entropy probably reaching its maximal limit, and every law of physic being broken by yet another physicist, I can’t help but wonder, ‘are we ever going to look back’?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">I am just back from watching a Stanley Kupric movie, killing kiss. Trust me, that was awfully slow. It was just an hour long, yet I couldn’t wait to get out of the hall. A year ago, hostel was so much fun. After LAN and Internet arrived, time seems scares.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Let’s assume that the damn 4<sup>th</sup> dimension didn’t exits. It would be awkward, wouldn’t it? There would have been no time, and that’s why we would still strive hard to finish thing ‘in’ time. Time or no time, mathematicians would have ‘assumed’ its existence anyway. That’s the beauty of mathematics; it can make a fool out of anybody!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">I know quite a lot of friends who are up all night, trying to set the balance right between academics and 24 hrs. Some smoothen the edges out through periodic night outs, some others have already burnt out. Quite frankly, ‘fun’ part in lost in the wilderness of time or the lack of it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">My day began at 10:30 am, up half the night thinking on what to blog the next day. Alarm rang at about 7:30, and surprise!!! I had time. When I woke up I realized it was a bit too less to crash for 3 more hrs. Anyway, I ran to the bathroom with a brush in one had and tooth paste in the other. I found monkeys had all the &#8216;time&#8217; in the world to ravage my washed cloths…again, the same set of cloths which I had washed second time. As my mind wandered around thinking of strangling the monkeys, I realized I had no time even to think of that, let alone chocking them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Then, in my humanities class, a video was shown on Indian govt., which in the name of conservation is snatching the very livelihood of tribes in northern Karnataka. The video was 52 min long, all of us were restless to get back to hostel even as the clock was striking 11:50, the scheduled lunch break. Would it hurt any one of us to stay back for 5 minutes?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The Byrds sang, ‘a time for this, a time for that….. n things…’. Are they kidding? A time for everything would mean a segmentation fault.<br />
Tip: Those who do not know about the segmentation fault, google for it.<br />
Whoever named it ‘the time magazine’ is a genius? Obviously, when we don’t have any, why not buy the magazine, serves as moral support anyway.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Then came my ‘Dynamics of machinery’ class. I would say he is the only prof in the institute who would say that he has enough time to cover the syllabus. What an eternal optimist! He left us in about 30 mins, 20 mins ahead of actual finish. I was working on my previous blog when my neighbour, Boxer, knocked, asking for an hour on my computer to do an assignment. I asked him to come back after 2 hrs as it wasn’t extremely important. Half an hour later when I offered him the computer, he said he had already completed the work in Animesh’s comp. Reason: he did not have time to wait.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Why do we have time zones? Probably cause its so precious. It is allocated to every country. Einstein claimed time was relative. Get real, it’s absolute, nobody has any of it. Finally I thank my readers for the time they spent on this blog. Please don’t ask yourself, “was it worth it?” or “was it worth the time?&#8221;<!--/codes_iframe--></p>
