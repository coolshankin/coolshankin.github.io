										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I argue that we progressively use more tangible and intangible resources from the government to acquire your income, and therefore, one ought to pay taxes at a higher and higher rate if they make more and more money.</em></p>
<p>If you google &#8220;justification for progressive taxation&#8221;, you will see plenty of arguments in favour of and against progressive taxation. I have listed some of them below. While I am mixed opinion about them, I found none of them to be compelling enough to pick any side. In this blog post, I will provide a new ethical justification for progressive taxation with which I hope even libertarians will agree (ha!).  I will first explain how much taxes you should pay for tangible services from the government, and I will then elaborate on intangible services from the government. I will then argue that the exact money you owe to the government is incalculable due to the intangible services, but this lead to a conclusion that a progressive taxation system is closest to being a fair system.</p>
<p>The most common (utilitarian) arguments in favour of progressive taxation are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The rich can afford to pay more, so they should pay more. (completely disagree)</li>
<li>It spurs economic growth because the rich do not spend all the cash they make, but the poor do. (partially agree)</li>
<li>It enables social mobility. (partially agree)</li>
</ol>
<p>The most common (libertarian) arguments against progressive taxation are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>It unfair because everyone should bare the responsibility for providing the revenue equally. (disagree)</li>
<li>It punishes success. (partially agree and partially disagree)</li>
<li>It is income redistribution, and therefore, theft. (partially agree and partially disagree)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why taxes? A flat tax, to be specific &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Everyone know that you pay taxes in order to provide for the services that the government. Simple! Everyone uses roads, bridges, communication networks etc. in order to earn their income. Since everyone uses them, you ought to equally pay for those service.</p>
<p><strong>Why a flat tax <em>rate</em>?</strong></p>
<p>Your income does not get deposited into your bank account out of the blue. Every dollar you earn comes from someone (you or someone else) has used the resources provided by the government. For example, the same road takes you to Walmart and Circuit City. Part of the reason for Walmart making more money than Circuit City is that more people used the road to go to Walmart rather than Circuit City. Therefore, Walmart has to pay more taxes; it used more resources from the government to make that money. Thanks to Walmart making more money, the government had to spend proportionally (assumption) more money to build and maintain the infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Sublinear, linear, or superlinear spending: An argument for taxing consumption:</strong></p>
<p>In the paragraph above, I assumed that government spending on the infrastructure to enable your income is proportional to your income. One can critically examine the claim. Because of economies of scale, one an argue that the cost to build and maintain an infrastructural setup is a sublinear function of the number of people using it, i.e., it takes less than twice as much money to build and maintained a road if it is being used by twice as many people. On the other hand, one can also argue that with a greater number of people using the roads, there are additional needs for maintaining law and order, traffic signals, etc., which do not follow necessary conditions for economies of scale to apply.  For instance, a Wall St. trader benefits immensely from the stock exchange, but a cook woking in a restaurant next door doesn&#8217;t.  Therefore, it makes more sense to tax consumption rather than income. Perhaps, we could have a system that taxes consumption alone, or we could have a system with minimal flat (or regressive, due to economies of scale) tax rate for basic resources and additional tax for consuming certain specific resources, or we can have a progressive taxation system. I believe these options do not make any major difference if the number are chosen properly. If statistics can prove me wrong, I would be glad to look at them.</p>
<p><strong>Intangible services</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the infrastructure and law and order maintenance for which an exact dollar amount may be calculated, government provides other services such as the protection of intellectual property rights, copyright laws, bankruptcy protection etc. Without these services, the industry in which you work would not have succeeded in making more money than others. Intellectual property rights are, perhaps, the most important factor in enabling companies to make money. If you happen in work in such industries (pharmaceutical, oil, information technology, finance, medical, mining, etc.), you make money than the rest of the population because you use such services provided by the government. The construction worker who makes less money does not need those services, and therefore, should not be held accountable to pay for them. In today&#8217;s system, if one makes a lot of money, it is almost certain that they benefitting from those intangible services way more than the rest of the population. Unfortunately, an exact  dollar amount may not be calculated for those services. This is exactly where progressive taxation system makes sense. One can argue about the exact rate of tax and how they should grow, but a progressive system is more fair than the rest.<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In which I describe how my idea of fairness is different from free market principles.</em></p>
<p>In this post, I talk about the definition of fairness in the context of economic transaction. Many of you may have simple framework based on free market principles to judge a transaction as fair or unfair. I have a different framework that is based on equality. This post should be read from a philosophical standpoint and not from a practical or enforcement standpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Two Transactions</strong></p>
<p>I will present two transactions to you. Both of them follow free market principles. I would like you to judge if these transaction are fair. First, a rich businessman approaches several equally rich engineers and arrives at $200 as a price for a job, which is given to least expensive engineer. Second, knowing that the price of the job was $200, the businessman goes to a poorer, desperate (for tangential reasons) engineers. The businessman uses the poorer engineers&#8217; lack of bargaining power to establish $50 as the price for the same job. All the engineers are equally skilled and efficient at the job. My question is: do you think the second transaction was fair? If the businessman goes to the poorer engineers first and then to the richer ones, are the same transactions fair?</p>
<p><strong>Fairness</strong></p>
<p>If you argue that the all transactions were fair because they were all mutually agreed upon by the parties involved (free market economics), I respect your judgement, but I disagree with it. I think that fairness and free market principle are different entities altogether. I think that free market is just one of the many possible systems to distribute capital and resources.</p>
<p>My framework to judge fairness is based on equality. If the businessman *knowingly* exploits the lack of the bargaining power, which has got nothing to do with the job, I think that he is being unfair. You may ask me how I know that $200 is the &#8220;real&#8221; price for the job. The key term in my definition is &#8220;knowingly.&#8221; If the businessman genuinely thought that $200 was too much, and that $50 is reasonable, I wouldn&#8217;t call it unfair. In the second case, where the businessman approaches the poorer engineers first, he does not really know the price of the job, and so he negotiates the best he can. I wouldn&#8217;t call that unfair either. We assume here that the businessman used his bargaining position, which had no relation to the job, to treat people in different ways. Fairness goes the other way too. If the engineers were to treat different businessmen differently, I would call them unfair too.</p>
<p><strong>What if it Happens to You?</strong></p>
<p>I would like to put the same question in the context of your employer. Suppose your boss knows that you and  your colleague are both equally productive and equally valuable to the company. And he also *knows* that you are desperate to keep this job. Perhaps, you and your spouse  just had a baby, and cannot afford to change health insurance plans, while your colleague  can afford to quit the job and look for a new one because he has a richer ancestry. Or, perhaps, your colleague may be as desperate a you are. If your boss decides that only your colleague gets a bonus for no reason (your boss tells you so), would you still call that fair? Remember that reason why he decided to treat you unequally had nothing do your job, but other tangential reason, and everything here follows free market principles; you are free to walk away from your job if you don&#8217;t like the salary.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Confession</strong></p>
<p>I knew that the previous owner from whom I bought my car was going out of country in a few days. So I used that information to lower the price I paid for the car. In my opinion, I was being unfair to him because the value of the car had got nothing do with his going abroad. Will I be unfair next time I am a part of such transactions? I think I will be. I am not taking a moral highground. I think that the social cost of my unfair actions is not very high. I hope I will be less selfish if the social costs are high.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to Foxconn, Walmart and Apple</strong></p>
<p>Clearly, everyone knows that Chinese workers are more desperate for work. The companies use this to exploit them. I have read many posts online that explain that it is fair because it follows free market principles, and that their life is better off as a result. I have to disagree with that reasoning. No one would complain if the employees has a decent standard of living. But we all know that condition of workers in Foxconn (<a title="Foxconn (ABC News)" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLuPtMvvwA0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>) and Walmart (<a title="Walmart: The high cost of low price" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hftb_DVuelo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>). The companies are not doing the worker a favour by giving them the job. It is business transaction in which the workers are being treated worse thay should be (based on my framework on fairness). The social cost of their actions is very high. That is the reason why their practices are frowned upon.</p>
<p><strong>Practical?</strong></p>
<p>I realise that enforcing my idea of fairness is not practical. Walmart can simply say that they genuinely believe that their worker do deserve health insurance. This is where government mandates come into play. I am not a fan of ideas that imply fairness if all rules are followed (government rules or otherwise). How would you decide if the rules are themselves fair? I think a judgement on what is fair should not have external dependence because it is a personal moral compass.</p>
<p><strong>Other Frameworks</strong></p>
<p>I have not had the time to read any of the following wiki links or books to which they refer. If you happen to know other frameworks (described in the links below or otherwise), do let me know.</p>
<p>a. <a title="Justice as Fairness" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_as_Fairness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice as Fairness</a>: John Rawls conception of Justice</p>

<p><strong>Comment Policy:</strong></p>
<p>If you diagree with me, provide your framework, and let me know what you think about the transaction with your employer.  It&#8217;s a simple &#8220;is it fair&#8221; question. Keep it to the point. Please do not explain free market principles to me in a hundred possible ways (willingness to pay, current value of the job to the engineer or businessman etc.). I have a different framework. Please respect it.<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Where I relate wars, capital punishment, environmentalism and feminism.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was rather unpleasant to watch Gov. Rick Perry being applauded for overseeing capital punishments in Texas during the Republican presidential debate last year. Even a supporter of capital punishment usually agrees that it is not carried out with pride but with a disappointment that such punishments are necessitated in our society[*].</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I noticed on wiki (<a title="Wiki: Capital Punishment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment">link</a>) that US is in really bad company with China, Iran, North Korea and Yemen in awarding death penalties. The rest of the &#8220;western&#8221; world (i.e., other than the US) does not see as many death penalties. China, Iran, North Korea and Yemen are some countries that are hated for their domestic policy. Countries with large number of capital punishment victims are usually totalitarian or dictatorial. US, on the other hand, is proud of being a &#8220;free nation.&#8221; Something was amiss. But then, the US is hated for it foreign policy. It has broken its own laws many times when they are deemed a threat to national security (<a title="Naom Chomsky" href="http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20110531.htm ">link</a>). There should be a factor that reconciles all these facts. I believe that it is the holier-than-thou attitude that reconciles the facts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I elaborate, I stress that I am not using holier-than-thou with a negative connotation. Holier-than-thou is usually associated with hypocrisy. My use is more generic.  If you expect a better pay at work for reasons such as race, caste or nationality, that is holier-than-thou attitude at play, and it is frowned upon for its hypocrisy. If you work harder then your peers, and then expect a better pay, it is reasonable, but it is also a holier-than-thou attitude at play. There is nothing bad about it in this context.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, let me explain how the holier-than-attitude relates harsh punishments and domestic or foreign policies. The US is notorious for waging wars all the time. War is imposing your idea of what is right upon others. Similarly, harsh punishments are awarded to those whom we deem unfit to live in the society and deny them some of the basic rights that the rest of us enjoy. Both of them have elements of the holier-than-thou attitude. I see capital punishment as a tangible manifestation of that attitude, which brings people to believe that those who have done something terribly wrong are not worthy of living anymore.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I checked out punishments in some of the kingdoms. Larger kingdoms have obviously waged wars and expanded from smaller-sized kingdoms. Are the punishments for crimes in those kingdom equally harsh? I found that the Chola dynasty, a small dynasty, had very little punishment such as fines even for crimes such as murder (<a title="Wiki: Chola Dynasty" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chola_dynasty">link</a>). The Rashtrakutas (<a title="Wiki: The Rashtrakuta Dynasty" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtrakuta_Dynasty">link</a>) were a little bigger dynasty. The punishments were harsh, but some &#8220;high&#8221; caste people were excluded from such punishments. When we get to really big empires such as the Roman empire or the Mughals, the punishments were &#8220;cruel and unusual&#8221; (<a title="Wiki: Roman military decorations and punishments" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_military_decorations_and_punishments">link</a>, <a title="Roman Punishments" href="http://www.roman-colosseum.info/roman-life/roman-punishment.htm">link</a>, <a title="Wiki: Execution by elephant" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_by_elephant">link</a>). Execution by elephants were common. In the British Empire, I could not find examples of cruel punishments during its &#8220;glory&#8221; days in England. Some links (<a title="Wiki: Penal Labour" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labour">link</a>, <a title="Wiki: Capital punishment in the UK" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_Kingdom">link</a>) do indicate that punishments were harsh before the fall of the empire. There may be exceptions to the rule that ambitious empires also practise cruel punishment, but I would like to see some more study on the correlation (religion may also offer more information).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Few years ago, I answered a survey questionnaire in which a few questions about our opinion on women&#8217;s rights and environmental policies were asked. At the end of the questionnaire, I was informed that those who support equal rights for women are also likely to support strong policies to preserve the environment. This brings us to Ecofeminism (<a title="Wiki: Ecofeminism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecofeminism">link</a>), which has its roots in the belief that &#8220;the social mentality that leads to the domination and oppression of women is directly connected to the social mentality that leads to the abuse of the natural environment.&#8221; I think that this is just a fancy way to explain that the holier-than-thou attitude (or lack of) is responsible for many of our views.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">[*] In the same way, military might is something that is forced upon us because we have enemies; displaying military might  (as during India&#8217;s Republic Day) is not something I am comfortable with.  Most agree that public hanging is unhealthy for a society. I don&#8217;t think that display of military might, similarly, is healthy. I think the US did the right thing by not releasing Osama bin Laden&#8217;s picture.<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul Krugman wrote (<a title="http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/mushy.html" href="http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/mushy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>) about the &#8220;stubborn persistence of bad food in England.&#8221; Paraphrasing the article, the quality of food in London dropped significantly due to rapid urbanisation that preceded good transportation system that brought fresh food from the farms. This created a big demand for canned food-based diet, and soon the demand for quality food dropped. This resulted in London being stuck in a bad equilibrium, where good food was not supplied because good food was not demanded. Enough critical mass needed to demand good quality food was created only after many Londoners were able to afford frequent foreign trips.</p>
<p>Krugman also noticed (<a title="No Heat and Bad Food" href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/31/no-heat-and-bad-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>) that <span class=" aptureTMMSelection"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; clear: none; cursor: auto; float: none; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; letter-spacing: inherit; margin: 0pt; outline: medium none; position: relative; text-decoration: inherit; text-indent: 0pt; text-transform: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: inherit; word-spacing: inherit; background-color: transparent; background-image: none; border: 0pt none; display: inline; padding: 0pt; line-height: inherit;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; clear: none; cursor: auto; float: none; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; letter-spacing: inherit; margin: 0pt; outline: medium none; position: relative; text-decoration: inherit; text-indent: 0pt; text-transform: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: inherit; word-spacing: inherit; background-color: transparent; background-image: none; border: 0pt none; display: inline; padding: 0pt; line-height: inherit;">Felix Salmon</span></span></span> attributes (<a title="The behavioral economics of Mexican central heating" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/12/30/the-behavioral-economics-of-mexican-central-heating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>) a similar reason (among others) for lack of central heating units in Mexico. A given Mexico dweller (including the rich) does not have central heating because other Mexico dwellers don&#8217;t have central heating. This &#8220;path dependency&#8221; creates a bad equilibrium, where one gets through the short-spanned Mexican winter without central heating.</p>
<p>Time columnist, Fareed Zakaria, explains (<a title="How Democracy Can Work in the Middle East  Read more" href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2045888-2,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>) that reforms and revolutions often go hand-in-hand in oppressive regimes. He says that the most dangerous phase in an autocratic regime is when the dictator decides to reform the economy. Reforms expose the citizens to new possibilities and create a demand for better governance. When the government is not able to meet the demands, revolutions occur. This account (<a title="http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/02/the_story_of_the_egyptian_revo.html" href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/02/the_story_of_the_egyptian_revo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>) articulates the line of thought expressed by Zakaria. Zakaria also states that stagnant countries like Syria and North Korea have remained more stable. Thus, a lack of knowledge creates a bad equilibrium.</p>
<p>So, what is common among the English food, Mexico&#8217;s central heating, and the Egyptian uprising? They follow a demand-driven economic model, where a bad equilibrium is possible.<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A month back, my friends and I were talking about funding for different departments and graduate research assistant stipend during summer. I learnt that some student get twice as much during summer than during regular semester. I hadn&#8217;t asked my prof about my pay-check then. I did concede that it was partly because I find it uneasy to talk about money. That&#8217;s when it occurred to me about write about cultural differences that I have encountered so far.</p>
<p><strong>Profit is a dirty word</strong></p>
<p>I had read an article (<a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2008/Varmaprofit.html">link</a>) by Amit Varma where he talks about &#8216;profit&#8217; being a dirty word during Nehru&#8217;s socialistic governance and later on until economic liberalisations. The thought of profit, and consequently money, being dirty have always been taught to us since primary education. I remember couplets that talk about working hard without really worrying about the result or money that you can get out of it. Also, I remember how angry parents used to get when, as a child, we prayed to god for anything materialistic. The idea that money is last thing to worry about is etched in our minds. Its hard to let go of such ideas in quick time. Asking for raise is not something Indians are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Even e-mailing profs for funding when going for an Internship is hard thing to do. Clearly, expecting money for you work is not wrong. But the idea of money being &#8216;dirty&#8217; is playing its role here. On the other hand, American students are pretty frank about it. Unlike Indians, they do not go to grad school if they are not funded. Understanding local culture and adopting them and letting go of our conservative mindset is what we need to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Tipping</strong></p>
<p>Indians in US are infamous for being bad tippers (it could just be a stereotype, but i have seen a few people in my university who refuse to tip). Despite arguing that waiters are not paid as much they are suppose to paid because it&#8217;s a &#8216;tipped-job&#8217;, some people refuse to accept what I say. We ought not to be so insensitive to any practice here. I believe that while in Rome, we should do as Romans do. There is a reason why romans do the things they do. We ought to respect that.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese Shopkeepers Handling Currency Notes<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I have guilty of being culturally insensitive too. In India, you are always taught to offer and receive anything (including money) with your right hand. Money is offered directly to the hand. Also, both the giver and the receiver should either be inside the house or outside when a transaction takes place. I think it&#8217;s just a way of saying, &#8220;I respect you&#8221;. There were two instances when I was in Tokyo when the shopkeepers asked me to place the currency notes on a tray. Forgetting that I was in completely different country, I gave it to their hand in dominating way. This happened twice. It was only later that I realised that I may have offended them. That was when I made a mental note of being sensitive to local customs. I still don&#8217;t know if I have offended them. Anyone who knows, please let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Language</strong></p>
<p>Recently, I read about a case (lost the link &#8230; sorry) in Canada about an Indian shop keeper who had used the words, &#8220;I will kill her if he doesn&#8217;t give the sweets to you&#8221; to a regular Canadian customer. We Indians know that &#8220;I will kill you&#8221; is used in jest by everyone. But in a different place, the implications are completely different. The shop keeper was arrested by the police on a complaint by the customer about the &#8220;death-threat&#8221;. I think the mis-understanding as later resolved. Such thing do happen by accident but it is in our best interest to adapt quickly.</p>
<p>A lot of things are lost in translation. I have heard this statement, supposedly from Koran: &#8220;If people do not convert to Islam, kill them (infidels) by swords&#8221;. I do not think it is true but even if it is, I am interested to know the context in which it was said. For all we know, &#8220;kill them&#8221; can mean &#8220;ignore them&#8221;. Who know what it meant 1300 years ago?</p>
<p>Student in India use &#8220;jobless&#8221; to say they are free to do stuff. I once said, &#8220;I will be jobless tomorrow, you can call me&#8221; and they appeared really concerned. Two seconds later I released my mistake and explained the meaning of &#8220;jobless&#8221; much to their amusement.</p>
<p>Any such funny or serious stuff you guys have experienced? Comment it.<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: This post has been edited for clarity and typos. </strong></p>
<p>What prompted me to write this is <a href="http://rajeev2004.blogspot.com/2008/03/thus-speaks-real-woman-we-do-not-want.html">another post</a> shared by my <a href="http://rahulbhatta.blogspot.com">friend</a> on Google Reader. It talks about Sarabjit Singh, a woman who did not want her husband released in exchange for terrorist. Kudos to her! I really admire her because she put her country before herself and her family. I did not appreciate the post when the writer called another person, who was desperate to get her family back during Kandahar hijacking, an anti-national. It is becoming rather fashionable to call somebody anti-national. Be it cutting flag coloured cake, playing musical version of national anthem, or if it looks like someone&#8217;s leg is facing the national flag. There are lawyers who make a living out of it. I want to explain why demand or negotiating release of hijacked passengers in lieu of terrorist is not anti-national, but plain human. I know some views are controversial, please do not jump to conclusions before reading this post completely.</p>
<p>One of the jobs of the Govt. is to protect its citizens. The govt. is elected by the people, and consequently it is the job of the society to elect the right government. In other words, it is the society which takes care of itself. When plane is hijacked, the govt. failed in its duty to protect its citizens. So what is wrong with demanding the govt to secure the release of the passengers? It is the govt. which has failed and has to set things right. The society is very much entitled to demand this. It is very disappointing to see that a part of a society thinks otherwise. They speak as if it is duty of the hijacked passengers to die for the country.</p>
<p>It is very easy to judge the relatives who are facing the trauma as &#8220;anti-national&#8221; by others who have no experience dealing with such uncertainties. Everyone loves their country, most of us love ourselves more. That&#8217;s the fact. I am really appalled by the ease with which the author of the post judged the woman  as being anti-national. I bet the author has never been in situation where there was a gamble for his loved one&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Many ask, &#8220;If we &#8216;give-in&#8217; to the terrorists, wont it send the wrong signal to the terrorists that every time a plane is hijacked, they can pull another of their terrorist heroes back from prison?&#8221; My response is the following: If you are scared that that signal we sent that day makes them think that hijacking a plane is solution to their problems, haven&#8217;t you<br />
already conceded that they will hijack again and there is nothing India can do to prevent that? Are you convinced that we can protect ourselves any more? This, to me, is the real felling of &#8220;giving in&#8221; to the terrorists.</p>
<p>In some sense, many think that govt. &#8220;gave up&#8221; to the terrorists. Here&#8217;s how I look at it: Had we remained stone hearted and let the passengers be killed, we are sending a signal that if we release a terrorist, we cannot catch him again, that we were very lucky to have caught him.</p>
<p>Lets assume that India has a reputation of storming the planes every time they are hijacked. Think for a moment, as a terrorist, what would you do? Would you attempt negotiation with the govt. from the hijacked plane? Or would you blow it up mid-air or against a tall building out of spite? I have a feeling this has been done before.</p>
<p>For once, before calling anyone anti-national, society ought to step into their shoes and look and the options before them. It is the fault of the government/society that the plane was hijacked. After the harm is done, society should try and rectify it. Not treat the victims like guinea pigs in a failed experiment and let them be killed by hijackers. The society has to take the responsibility of bringing them back alive.</p>
<p>Talking about social responsibilities, let me express my views on capital punishment as well. I am myself not sure about capital punishment, but there is one case where I am against it: in punishing serial killers. I was in favour of capital punishment before watching the movie &#8216;monster&#8217;, which portrays a life of a prostitute who becomes a serial killer out of circumstance. I am against capital punishment given out to psychopathic serial killers.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t just &#8220;become&#8221; psychopathic serial killers. It is the society which makes them. It is the society which gives them tough choices and it is the society which treats them badly. When the results aren&#8217;t favourable, society wants to treat the person like a guinea pig and kill him. I dont like the &#8216;tax payer&#8217;s burden&#8217; argument about keeping them in jail (when there is no hope for them to recover) either. It is the society which made them that way. From a moral point of view, society should pay for its failed experiment.</p>
<p>Another argument I have heard is that we all have lived in the same society, and we did not turn out to be serial killers. My simple answer is that every individual is unique, and if you cant respect that, you are the one who doesn&#8217;t deserve a place in society. Some favour death penalty for the &#8216;sentiments&#8217; of victims&#8217; families. I dont buy that because the decision which the family takes is an emotional one and not necessarily the rational one.</p>
<p>Moving a little away from the topic, people love to call those who have left the country for education or job as anti-national. IITians, and in last ten years, NITs, BITS etc, are the main targets. Let&#8217;s examine that claim as well.</p>
<p>Firstly, &#8216;the lakhs of rupees spent on an IITian&#8217; argument. As an IITian, I can say that we were not put in luxury. We had to pay for everything from electricity bill to Rs 600 for renting a gown for the convocation to &#8216;security&#8217; for the hostels. They subsidized the mess (which was horrible) up to Rs 8 per day per student which, I agree, is quite significant. But then who isn&#8217;t subsidized in India? Petrol is subsidized. Diesel is subsidized for farmers, but other people buy diesel cars anyway (they are real anti-nationals if you ask me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). Gas is subsidized to every household. Taking all of that into account, I am not sure if the subsidy for us is more significant than what is given to the rest of the country. Profs are paid for research and teaching us. Its their job and cannot be counted towards the &#8220;burden&#8221; of the tax payers. The only place where, I think, the lakhs of rupees figure makes sense is the licensing of the softwares for research. Sophisticated Labs and Labs Equipments are something which undergraduates seldom use. But, I am sure any research that is done in IITs and IISc comes back to nation as inputs for ISRO, DRDO etc. for India&#8217;s development. Most of research is done by PhD students who stay in country. I am damn sure the lakhs of rupees figures is not the true figure. The realistic figure, I believe, is a much reasonable amount. I do realize that rest of the colleges do not even get the minimal facilities that we &#8220;enjoy&#8221;. That only talks about govt. apathy.</p>
<p>Secondly, lets look at the reason why the &#8220;brain-drain&#8221; occurs. A student expected to pay back to country though research or through entrepreneurship. As far as research is concerned, it is known that hardly any importance is given to it in India. Expenditure towards research takes a back seat. Infrastructure in India is lacking. Who is responsible for that? Government/Society. How about entrepreneurship? India was a socialist country 20 years back. Little wonder that brain-drain was rampant back then. Today it&#8217;s, thanks to economic reforms, much less. Again its the government/society responsible for that. Calling people anti-national is doing society no good. There are very few who put their country ahead of their personal ambitions, they are truly amazing. Other are human, not anti-national.</p>
<p>Also, why is the responsibility of the chosen few to bring the country out of the mess it is in. What is the role of the people who judge others as anti-national? Isn&#8217;t that an indication of resigned society putting burden on a some of its members to bring them back on their feet.</p>
<p>Before calling anyone &#8220;anti-national&#8221; the society should learn its responsibility.<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a situation where there is a wealthy businessman, and he has an excellent B-Plan to make more money. He opens a mall in few villages, and offers low prices for an extended period of time enough to drive the mom-and-pop stores out of business. He makes loss over the period but, as he is wealthy, he is fine. As he monopolizes the villages. He then raises the prices to values higher then before. Is this legal? Yes. Ethical? Thats a different debate. Should the govt protect the small time investors and prevent this situation? Obviously. But How?  Please comment on that after reading the rest of the post.</p>
<p>Just note few of the things which make the situation tricky. The wealthy businessman are few in number. So the competition is that much less. Even if there are a little too many for comfort, it makes economic sense for all of them not to compete against one another. There are better off looking at different villages as market or selling different products. As the govt is obligated to protect the interest of all its citizens, what laws should be implemented to prevent rich business from growing richer at expense of village folks?</p>
<p>All the controversy and walmart bashing that you see is because of their tactics. In US, which is run on the ultimate form of capitalism, huge chains like sears, circuit city, walmart, target, sports academy are present everywhere. But single-shop owners are not present in that large a number.</p>
<p>During our fortnightly lab meetings, another issue came up. It was possible that any of there stores, sometime in future, record the stuff a person purchases, and charge each of them accordingly, i.e., different price for different costumers for the same product. More frequently you buy a product, more you are willing to pay for the it, and hence by a capitalist principle, more they are gonna charge you for it. As scary as it sounds, it not something to be scared about (From my limited knowledge of economics, correct me if i am wrong). Price rises for everyone. And hence the inflation. And so you currency will lose its value. Consequently, your employer will raise your salary. No harm done!</p>
<p>If you are wondering how is the previous case different from this one, remember that the in the previous case, only a part of the population is affected. So raise in inflation is not significant. And so only the village folks get poorer. We need a solution in capitalist domain. If we venture into socialist/communist form of governance we do have some solution. But, get you creativity going in solving this problem in capitalist domain.</p>
<p>I had put this for discussion with a group of friends. Here are some of the points that came up.</p>
<p>A <a title="Economic Times Link" href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Kiranas_can_live_with_big_retail_Govt_study/articleshow/2618390.cms " target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> has shown that  &#8220;kiranas&#8221; can  coexist with big time retailers. But I am not sure if it talks about India alone or all over the world</p>
<p><strong>Few solutions:</strong></p>
<p>One of the  plausible solutions is moving towards socialist form of governance specifically for food grains, cereals, oil and basic amenities is a govt controlled efficient Public Distribution System. India had a decent network of Fair-Price Shops (nyaya bele anagadi in Kannada) or Ration Depots all over the country. But of course, govt interferenace has its drawbacks of corruption among others. As the Govt gave up it&#8217;s exclusive procurement rights, the system died out. Govt no longer has access to sufficient food grains. The private companies are quick to approach the farmers and get the produce at a lesser cost and once they have it, they can import/export or process it depending on the market needs. This can lead to hoarding.</p>
<p>Another solution that was tried (targeted at walmart) was to restrict the area of shopping area to a certain value. In India, too, such a law was tried. They were aimed at stopping tata-birlas from running more business. But it was circumvented by opening business under proxy names.</p>
<p>Charge large taxes on goods sold at higher rates elsewhere. This again is some kind of regulation which might not work too well owing to transportation cost etc.</p>
<p><strong>Capitalism on Waitresses and Waiters</strong>:</p>
<p>Tipping culture exists in US because some people are paid less than minimum wage. They are paid less than minimum wage because it is a tipped job! When waitress or waiters earn less then minimum wage even after tips they dont report it because it becomes an excuse for the employer to call them incompetent and fire them. More on that <a title="Wait Staff Woes" href="http://www.semanticoverload.com/2007/12/05/wait-staff-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (via <a title="Desi Pundit" href="http://www.desipundit.com/2007/12/05/wait-staff-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desipundit</a>).</p>
<p>I am a capitalist too and love the idea of free market, but it is quite cruel at its fullest level. Do comment on possible solutions to the problem I described above.</p>
<p>Happy new years to all my readers!<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being in India, you are never more than just couple of hundred meters away from a tradition that is followed simply because it has always been followed. Mythology is used to explain most of the weird superstition. A good work (<em>shuba kaarya</em>) is never started the day after a new moon day as the Mahabharata war started on that day; onion, garlic, tomatoes etc are seldom used in cooking (in highly orthodox places) because they were no created by God but by Vishwamitra among others. The educated ones assume that there is a scientific basis for all of this and carry on the tradition.</p>
<p>One such tradition in followed in Karnataka is preparation of Vada during death Ceremony. Vada is prepared in many families only during the annual death ceremony. If prepared during other times, it is not donut shaped but saucer shaped. This issue came up when my room mate, from Andra Pradesh, wanted to prepare Vada for Diwali or Dasara. It was apparently a tradition at his place. The plan was later ditched as my other room-mate from Karnataka told him about this. Around same time, abcd room-mate was talking his mom getting mad when he had shaved his head once. It is a common knowledge that head is shaved usually in case of death in the family (Thirupathi Apart). If such tradition are broken, it is seen as a utmost contempt and blasphemy.</p>
<p>It should be hard to see that such tradition mostly serve as a form of mass communication to inform the community about whats happening at your place. There are certain kind of dishes that are prepared during a Birthday, and others during the death ceremony. You really don&#8217;t want people to come into your place and ask, &#8220;is it a birthday or did someone die?&#8221; To avoid any such conflict, certain tradition do make sense. It is for this reason that I am a believer in saying, &#8220;While in Rome, do as Romans do&#8221; Suppose a family moves from their own place to a new one, they shouldn&#8217;t refrain from changing their tradition. It is nice to stand up to what you think is right, but at the same time you should be bothered about inviting wrong questions such as the one above, when you are adamant about following the tradition you have always followed.</p>
<p>Many of the card games usually depends on the hand that you get. Bridge is an exception. Played in teams of two, even with the worst possible hand, a game can be won. The game is all about establishing a protocol with your teammate about the hand you have and making right judgment about how many tricks you are going to win. An informed judgment about winning only three tricks and eventually doing so can get bring your team up. I don&#8217;t play Bridge, from what I know, there are several tried and tested methods to communicate to the partner over the table. Needless to say that a sound knowledge of them is necessary to win a game.</p>
<p>Salsa in competitions and bigger occasions are rehearsed and performed several times before presenting them on the stage. However, many are dance are performed impromptu when there are experienced dancers. Built on certain basic steps, all the swirls and the turns are established on the spot through dance gesture by the leader and the follower should be responsive enough to reciprocate the moves. Though it takes a lot of practice to look elegant in front of an audience the crux of the whole matter lies in interpreting the leaders&#8217; moves. There are several such standards in salsa too based on the place where they are practiced.</p>
<p>I dont know how many of you would played this wonderful game called Mafia (aka Ware wolf) (not the video game, check the wiki link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(game) ). It is a game with the good guys (villages) and the bad guys (wolfs). The wolfs know who else is wolf. Villages are uninformed. Villages, fortunately, have policeman and doctor amongst them. Policeman can find an identity (villager, doctor or wolf) during the game. Doctor can choose to heal a person whom he think the wolf are going to kill. The game proceeds with night time (after all the players are assigned their roles secretly). A moderator asks wolves to open their eyes and point to thei possible victim. After the wolves have come to an agreement they convey it to the moderator (not aloud &#8230; no one is suppose to know anything). Then doctor can choose to save a person whom he thinks is going to get killed. And then policeman can get to know the identity of one person from the set of players.</p>
<p>Based on who was chosen to kill, based on policeman&#8217;s knowledge, the good guys have to kill all the wolves. Wolves, on the other hand, should try to defend themselves or be sly enough to blame an another person and make the majority vote him out of the game. Remember that policeman simple cannot reveal himself initially as wolves will go for the policeman next night. Same argument goes for the doctor. The game in uninteresting during the begining when there is nothing to go by. As the game moves on based on knowledge of policeman(if he is not killed) game get really interesting and at times emotions and rage runs high.</p>
<p>Having played this game many time in our hostels and also in the Himalayas :), it is a game where communication is the key. Its all about policeman trying to convince others about who the wolves are and wolves trying to implicate others though good arguments. Certain signs of being a wolf is being too attentive or under attentive in the game, or to fumble an argument. Wolf, sometimes, kill deceptively to implicate someone else and thus communicate wrong idea while the opposite works for the good guys.</p>
<p>If you are still wondering what common to Tradition, Salsa, Bridge and Mafia, it the idea of effective communication that makes them a great, for lack of a better word, entity. Nature too has quite an effective communication skill. There is a lull before the strom, tremors before an earth quake, low tide before tsunami and, of course, melting of ice caps before &#8230;.</p>
<p>PS: Freakonomics &#8230; well i know the article is not about ecomomics .. but couldn&#8217;t find a better title</p>
<p>PPS: Pics will come later when I get my own laptop in 2-3-4 weeks.<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I did want to post DC and NYC pics, but I will do that later. There are a lot more things I want to say about the place.</p>
<p>Roads</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some people out there in our nation who don&#8217;t have maps&#8221; (<a title="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj3iNxZ8Dww" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>)&#8230; that&#8217;s so not true. They may not have world map, but many here do have road maps. Finding ways is much easier in India. To get from point A to B, you may have to know about 2-3 three villages or town you should cross and the direction on milestones will take you where you want to go. But here, there are hardly a few boards on Interstates which show the direction. You have to use sites like google maps or mapquest to get direction before you head to a place. The other alternative is road maps. Every highway has several exit roads which interconnect two highways. You will have to hop from one to another about 2-3 times in those many hours (<a title="directions from dc to nyc" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;saddr=Washington,+DC&amp;daddr=New+York,+NY+10001&amp;sll=40.91271,-75.925195&amp;sspn=2.8683,5.141602&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=39.83385,-75.509033&amp;spn=2.914611,5.141602&amp;z=8&amp;om=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>). Exits from highways may be on the left or the right side of the road, being on the correct lane is very important. If you happen to get lost, you need maps to get back on track. You wont find people on the street on a highway like in India to guide you and neither are there any directions on the boards (only the exit numbers are marked).</p>
<p>I was at Pink Floyd tribute band concert and during the break an old man (American) was talking about way Indians stop in the middle of the highway to check for directions and causing accidents because of fast trucks behind them. He said that about Indian Women driver in particular. he has seen it happen several times.</p>
<p>Road signs:</p>
<p>They are abundant. &#8220;Side walk closed, cross here&#8221;,&#8221;men at work, lower speed limit, 35 mph&#8221;, &#8220;men at work, turn head lights on&#8221;, &#8220;yield&#8221; etc. My favorite one is seen in Pennsylvania (not in Delaware or New Jersey for some reason): &#8220;Bridge may be Icy&#8221;. The reason eluded me for a month (thats why it my favorite) until my room mate told me why. In winter, there is sub zero air both over and under the bridge, while roads have cold air just over them, so bridge may indeed be icy in winter but not roads.</p>
<p>Resource consumption</p>
<p>All you read in news paper about USA being the biggest consumer of resource is true. Every two weeks, we go to super market to buy groceries. For every couple of items, we are given a polythene cover. There are loads of them lying in my home right now. Its hard to avoid it as we have to buy stuff all together for two weeks. The concept of commercial shops close to residence area and buying stuff for 2-3 days is non existent here. It is tough to avoid the use of plastic here. I remember the time (nearly 15 years ago) when most of the stuff were handed out wrapped in news papers.</p>
<p>The effort to reduces the consumption is also silly. I found a pamphlet on a hand dryer replacing paper tower claiming hand dryers are environmentally more friendly as trees are not cut. How they forget about the coal for the electricity used by the hand dryer? In my department, the printer gives out a page printing just one line with user name, date and time of the document it is printing out next. Everyday there are at least a pile 200-300 empty (but for that one line in the header) papers next to the printer. I do take some home to work out my assignments, but there is only so much i can do. The fact that upto 2000 pages can be printed every semester doesn&#8217;t help.</p>
<p>MRP:</p>
<p>There is no mrp on the food products and other consumer products which are bought regularly. I am not sure if this is a feature of capitalism or if its is in USA alone. We have to go by the price written in on the rack. They are consistent with price encoded in the bar codes. Because there is no MRP, prices vary from supermarket to supermarket with walmart being the cheapest.</p>
<p>Academics:</p>
<p>At least in my university, every course has a prescribed text book which is followed. I prefer this system rather having to write notes manage material from several sources. There are tonnes of assigments, quizes with midterm and end term to keep you on your toes all the time. During the orientation, there were couple of lectures on plagiarism in research and cheating etc. Kind if image that is projected in India about USA is that people obey rules student rarely cheat. Well, its not all that rosy. I do find copied work when I grade assignments and the average in assignments is usually high. Bottom line is that there are all kinds of students here.</p>
<p>Weekends:</p>
<p>Though my place is a small town. Many activities happen during the week end apart from foot ball. There are concerts, plays etc happening all the time. The one big advantage of being in a big university is that there are loads of workshops, activity clubs etc in place for students to engage in. Be it adventure club that has a hike, trek or rafting trip organized every week or community dace workshop that meets every week, there are stuff to do that can rejuvenate you from the academic work load.</p>
<p>Big fat Greek fraternities</p>
<p>There are number of fraternities here which are all named with three random Greek letter. &#8220;Phi Beta Kappa&#8221; &#8220;Alpha Pi Epsilon&#8221; etc etc (i am making them up, for all that i know, they may actually exist). From the wiki link (<a title="wiki link for freternities and their greek acronym" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>), I find that they are so named to abbreviate they motto in Greek. There is one named &#8220;Delta Phi Theta&#8221;, and when written in capitals, it reminds me of the deathly hollows <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Ads:</p>
<p>There is standard protocol for Ads here</p>
<p><em>A: I have this problem<br />
B: Ok, have you heard of this product?<br />
A: No, what is it?<br />
B: It is &lt;blah blah&gt;<br />
A: What are its advantages<br />
B: &lt;blah blah&gt;</em></p>
<p>Thats it! and if its an ad for a medicine, it usually end with, &#8220;side effects may include headache, nausea, vomiting, fever and liver damage&#8221;. Thee are some good ads, but only a handful.</p>
<p>There are couple of new ad style that are common here. Any event that has to be publicized, balloons with the event &#8216;logo&#8217; are strung around the bus stop area for people to notice. Neat Idea I think. Also, there is this airplane which carries a huge poster around the city all day with Gaico (insurance company) ad on it. I wonder if it is efficient at all. No one looks at it and on foot ball days, when it is most common, people watch foot ball, not some plane flying around the town.</p>
<p>Archtechture</p>
<p>Most of the universities are very old. This is very much evident in the architecture here. It does add to the beauty of the place. There are new buildings in place, but the campus is dominated by the old and red buildings. Purdue is also similar in this aspect. I am not sure about other universities but given that many universities came into existence in 19th century, I wont be surprised if all of them look similar.</p>
<p>Coins:</p>
<p>The cost of any product is not a multiple of a quarter (25 cents). It can be $2.37 or $4.56. After every transaction, you are left with load on 1 cent, 5 cent, 10 cent and 25 cent coins. I have about 80 (all put together) of them in my room. I have no clue how to dispose them. The bright side is you wallet gets heavier every time you spend :).</p>
<p>Cleanliness:</p>
<p>Toilet papers are not clean. I have seen people throw cigarette butts carelessly on the roads. Other than that, yeah, the country is very clean. There are dustbins everywhere. With a lower population, it is very easy to keep it clean. Take New York, with so many people, it is as chaotic as India. The traffic is disorderly and the place is not all that clean esp china town area.</p>
<p>Cultural and Religion:</p>
<p>Hmmm &#8230; the only thing that you will notice is some people don&#8217;t dress according to, lets just say, &#8220;Indian Culture&#8221; (don&#8217;t ask me what it means). When everyone around you is similar, you hardly notice it, and it not at all a distraction. People do wear shorts toclass and no one complains and no one takes an offense.</p>
<p>Many students works here. Libraries, labs etc are all managed by students who earn from part time positions. I think such a system must be developed in India as well. We have them in IITs where a few things are manageed by students, but they are not paid for it. This is very option when scholarship for financially challenged students is limited.</p>
<p>Religion and caste make headlines all the time in India. With most of the country being Christian, it occasionally makes headlines here. In a local daily, it was published that about 14% of Americans were found to be atheist. Thats a pretty big number I thought. There is this person who preaches about Christianity everyday in the afternoon near a building where some people usually gather around. On one occasssion, a few non-believers started arguing with him. As expected, it went on and on. At one point one of them raised a point of being narrow minded when anyone considers Christianity being the real truth. The preacher replied, &#8220;To me, calling some one narrow minded is a high school taunt. When you don&#8217;t know is murder and rape is good or bad, you are open minded. After all the arguments, when you know that its bad, you are automatically closed minded! It just a high school taunt.&#8221; The argument carried on (obviously). I left the place thinking about a similar experience I had when I was called narrow minded for not accepting violence as a solution.</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>Coffee</p>
<p>Americans love their coffee as much as South Indians love their filter coffee. Junta get their spill proof glass to buses and classes and having during the course of the day.<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update:</strong> I removed a few lines that I did not think were ok here.</p>
<p>I thought I will wait for a month before I pen my first impressions on America rather than writing a post immediately. Here are a few things I noted down about the place.</p>
<p>Friendliness:</p>
<p>About a year ago, there was survey conducted about politeness and Indians turned out to be the most rude people. After traveling to Japan and being here for nearly two months, I must say with a heavy heart that it is true. You are always greeted with a smile every place you visit. Millions of &#8216;thank you&#8217;s and &#8216;sorry&#8217;s may sound artificial initially but its surely better than frowns you receive back home in a government offices.</p>
<p>Why brain-drain?</p>
<p>Academia is very friendly towards students. Much more than in India.</p>
<p>Back in IITM, in my last year, there was circular sent saying student have to be in exam hall at 8:50 for 9:00 am exam. It was more of a guideline everyone thought. When 3rd year mech. students (I was in 4th year then) made it at 8:55, they were not allowed to write the test for 30 minutes. Thats the difference in attitude in two counties. HOD of Mech, IITM has no right to complain of brain drain. You can&#8217;t expect students to be obedient enough to stay back in iitm after being treated indifferently.</p>
<p>Paper Work:</p>
<p>When is comes to paper work, this place is no better than India. We still need to carry paper from one department to another to get things done. But at each place, work get done in quick time as all the tasks are computer based. My friend lost his passport after coming here. The assistance he received from Indian Embassy was pathetic. He complained that no one spoke to him in English in Washington embassy. Any English he spoke was not responded to. He had to run around DC and NYC and several hundred bucks later, got his duplicate passport. Now, his I94 will take 2 more months. I guess its typical of Govt. offices to take such a long time.</p>
<p>Punctuality and road discipline:</p>
<p>Except on the days on foot ball (American foot ball), buses are always on time. To the last  minute. You can always expect trains to be fast as they are computer handled, but these guys manage to run buses on time. Lane discipline is amazing too. Hardly anyone ever jumps a red light. When I drive in India, I always slow down even on a green signal because I &#8220;know&#8221; someone will jump the signal. It is scary initially when every vehicle zooms past an intersection on green light.</p>
<p>Earlier, about 6-7 years ago, buses in Bangalore used to be punctual despite the unpredictable traffic. I now don&#8217;t think it true after  the population explosion of sorts in Bangalore.</p>
<p>Foot ball and Base ball:</p>
<p>They as big as cricket in India. A person who claims that base ball is a boring game and 2020 cricket is good is a hypocrite. I am sure most of Indian don&#8217;t follow base ball and simply pass a judgment. And American foot ball is a big craze here. I have seen people holding huge banner begging for tickets on weekends in this place. I wish to understand the game too. Thats one more thing to do on week ends.</p>
<p>A lot of people say that love for soccer is more than that for cricket because people who follow soccer also madly follow club soccer. But in India, the regional cricket is hardly followed by masses. One should realize that given the frequency of International Tournaments in Foot Ball, naturally other forms of soccer gain popularity.</p>
<p>International PresenceMy university does boast of international presence but 60-70% of international presence is made by Chinese and Indians. And talking about China, pub culture is looked doen upon just like in India. And also, there are a few Chinese  who would love to have a sibling but cannot as it is illegal for couple to have more than one child. Coming back from CD trip as part of international orientation, a chinese girl was saying about many people deciding to stay in US because of one-child policy back home. My opinion: China&#8217;s dictatorship/ communism is just a ticking time bomb, Tienanmen&#8217;s square massacre was just a beginning. Also,  I hope Burma get its independence soon. Walk On!</p>
<p>Fall :</p>
<p>Trees change colour and shed their leaves. Until now these were true only in text books <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But yeah &#8230; this place is damn green. I some how fail to understand the garden city title to Bangalore. Even 10 years back, it was never this green.</p>
<p>Food:</p>
<p>Dear god .. its so bland! Thankfully, we have all the spices at home to cook. Americans don&#8217;t have trouble understanding my accent, but every i say vegetarian, they ask me to repeat it.  Indian food is expensive &#8230;. the restraunts call it &#8220;exotic&#8221; here.</p>
<p>Coming soon: Pics from NYC and DC and few other things i may have missed here</p>
