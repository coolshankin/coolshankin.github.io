										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am unimpressed by Google&#8217;s &#8220;sting&#8221; operation and their accusations (<a title="Details on Google's operation" href="http://searchengineland.com/google-bing-is-cheating-copying-our-search-results-62914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>) against Bing. All Google did was expose a vulnerability in Bing&#8217;s algorithm and then cry wolf. Google should have conducted two more experiments before coming to their current conclusion. First, I will explain why the current operation does not mean anything (partly explained <a title="Bing's respose to Google's accusation" href="http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/02/02/setting-the-record-straight.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). Second, I will discuss other experiments that Google needed to do before making their accusation.</p>
<p>Going back a few years, a search term, &#8220;miserable failure,&#8221; linked to George W Bush. This &#8220;Google Bomb&#8221; was achieved in the <a title="Google Bombs Explained" href="http://google.about.com/od/socialtoolsfromgoogle/a/googlebombatcl.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following</a> way: Suppose a link reads &#8216;apples&#8217;, but links to a webpage on oranges, Google makes an association between apples and the webpage on oranges. If there were 500 webpages had links reading &#8216;apples&#8217; but pointed to oranges, Google search on &#8216;apples&#8217; would have led to the webpage on oranges. Similar tactics were used on the search term, &#8220;miserable failure,&#8221; to lead it to George W Bush&#8217;s site. Today, Google&#8217;s algorithm is robust enough not to fall for the same tactic.</p>
<p>Bing also makes similar associations based on search strings (used in Google. Amazon eBay etc.) and the websites clicked by the users. Google hard-coded some synthetic, gibberish search string to lead to a specific webpage. After fifteen days of using IE to search for the same synthetic queries and then clicking the link, Bing made the association between the search strings and the web pages. This happened to less than 10% of the synthetic queries. Google then accused Bing of copying their result. Isn&#8217;t Google&#8217;s experimental results similar to Google Bombs?  The only difference is the source of the data. This just exposed the vulnerability of Bing, and nothing more. Yes, the data comes from the publicly-available results from a rival company. It was not intentional (benefit of the doubt). In the next update, Bing should try and reduce its dependence on that to be fair.</p>
<p>Two more experiments are needed to conclude that Bing copies Google. First experiment is look for common queries that give different results in Google and Bing. Google should freeze the results for that query and then observe Bing to see if the results on Bing change over time to match Google&#8217;s results. Second experiment is to look for commonly-used queries that give same results in both Google and Bing. Google should manually change their results and then wait for Bing to reflect the same changes. If Google had designed these experiments and disclosed the results, I would have given them some credit.</p>
<p>I am sure Google knows how to derive conclusions from a set of experiments. They should know better than conclude that Bing is copying Google based on their synthetic-query experiment. Google&#8217;s PageRank algorithm and search results (by Google and others) rely of statistical aggregates to work efficiently. Synthetic queries are not statistically significant. Google should not be crying wolf.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Don&#8217;t you think that Google looked for examples other than &#8220;torsoraphy&#8221; and did not find any? If they did, don&#8217;t you think they would have reported that?<!--/codes_iframe--></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">My friend, two days back, was asking us on what we look forward to this semester. We were talking about uninteresting courses we have this semester. Thanks to the administration of IITM, we have been enjoying with our LAN and Internet for about 6 months now. What the diro and other admin people have done is given us a thing or two to look forward to. It could be a movie, a song or even your project, technology has always guided us through. This time around, it has kept every one occupied. With vested potentials of LAN known to all of us, not a single minute is spared in this institute to use it to the maximum.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">If anyone has visited my profile here, you find one of my interests to be algorithm and programming. I have enthusiastically taken part on all online programming contests I have got my hand on. I use internet to look out for tougher problems and better competition. It’s wonderful for all of us to wake up every day, and think of something challenging and ponder over it for the rest of the day. Internet is always an answer to any project, any presentation or any assignment we are given.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;">The story has a bitter part too. In the humanities course of mine, the free-rider attitude was talked about. It’s simply something in you that says you alone cannot bring the system down (or up). That unfortunately is problem with the LAN here. Not everybody shares files that are worth sharing, because of which all of us are losing out more entertainment. What people don’t understand here is that every individual can make LAN better. Share files, people! That’s what LAN is for.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Yet again there are other set of people who open files over LAN itself causing comps to slow down, the irritated user then stops sharing his files. This is further emptying the LAN. This is just a food for thought: the free rider’s attitude is what making </span>India<span style="font-family: arial;"> such an unclean place to live in and such a corrupt nation to be ashamed about!</span><!--/codes_iframe--></p>
