					<description><![CDATA[I agree that FB, twitter etc.. are powerful media to upgrade the knowledge -&#039;common knowledge&#039;
On NOTA:
Nota can opted for the following reasons
-I want to reject all candidates
-I do not want to vote and my vote should not be misused by others
-I do not want to participate in this election (some areas boycotted the election process)
-I am not interested in this democratic process

A voter presses NOTA button intentionally, that means it not INVALID.
It is valid and tells the Election commission to take care of the election process in a better way. Hence it is a powerful option for voter. If NOTAs are more, political parties have to correct themselves and governance to be improved. 
Instead of boycotting the election process, opt for NOTA and thereby attract political parties&#039; attention.]]></description>

Thanks! Yes, the role of the media is to make things common knowledge. I am not all that comfortable with compulsory voting, but it is really just a very minor inconvenience (a lot less inconvenient than filing taxes every year before a deadline) if voting booth are not far away and a holiday is declared. With NOTA and the option to reject all candidates, I am neutral to it. And yeah, my writing style is very academic, and I think it is a good thing :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice one Shankar! Great take on how twitter and facebook made some issues common knowledge. My two cents:
1) Your point on Twitter is well taken, I think there is a subtler point here. In an open society it is the role of media to make issues &quot;common knowledge&quot;. Obviously in states with high government control, media doesnt fulfill this responsibility. Thats where uncontrollable outlets like Twitter and Facebook provide the necessary medium. 
2) Your point about the NOTA is the first credible reason for NOTA I have come across. I always felt what would NOTA achieve? What would happen if the majority vote went to NOTA? Anyway, I think in a democracy it is irresponsible to not vote. I always felt that along with NOTA there should be a requirement that everyone should vote, absent exigent circumstances. I dont think one has a fundamental right not to vote, but one has a fundamental right not to choose any candidates on the ballot. Thats where NOTA comes in. 

P.S. : Which journal are you submitting this paper to?]]></description>

By saying &quot;Well, are you paying the American labourer as low as the Chinese labourer because you can get away with it &quot; You are making the issue truly one dimensional. The fact is there is one more player in the equation: the government. Government is responsible for setting rules that ensure a fair game. period.

Analogy: US govt. sets maximum speed of 20mph on roads with schools. Indian road transport authority has no such rule. I am sure 100% of people here will drive at much greater speeds through such roads in India, if there is no traffic etc. Does this mean we disregard the lives of school children. No. Humans have the tendency of operating as close to the limit as they sense practical. And back to your point: this applies both to the businessman and the laborer. Within their own game, the businessman is trying to maximise his profit, while the laborer is trying to maximise what his body can earn.

Directly (by setting a minimum wage) or setting fair labour rule, it is the role of the government to set rules that permit a fair game. In a democracy, it comes from the people (the workers election). In a communist government, it comes through social unrest (when the workers ultimately get fed up of exploitation)]]></description>

Well, are you paying the American labourer as low as the Chinese labourer because you can get away with it or because you genuinly believe that the low salary is what they deserve? If it is the former, you will change your rate depending on the bargaing power of the other guy. If it is the later, you will be consistant (and reluctantly pay more, only if necessary). If you understand my post, you will know my answer to your question.

UPDATE: When I am talking about being consistant, a relavant question to ask is if I would pay my future self the same pay as I am paying the Chinese/American worker now? Then you will know if you are really consistant with your idea about what is the good pay for a job. When you really believe that it is the deserving pay, you will pay your future self the same amount too. But if you are just doing that to get away with it, you will have a different rules for your future self.

Read this: You will see how equality plays a role in deciding a just society:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&quot;How would you define a just society?&quot;

&quot;A moral philosopher called John Rawls attempted to say something about it with the following example: Imagine you were a member of distinguished council whose task it was to make all the laws for a future society.&quot;
&quot;I wouldn&#039;t mind at all being on that council.&quot;
&quot;They are obliged to consider absolutely every detail, because as soon as they reach an agreement - and everybody has signed the laws - they will all drop dead.&quot;
&quot;Oh...&quot;
&quot;But they will immediately come to life again in the society they have legislated for. The point is that they have no idea which position they will have in society.&quot;
&quot;Ah, I see.&quot;
&quot;That society would be a just society. It would have arisen among equals.&quot;

My framework is a philosophical one. I made the disclaimer early enough. My framework can only be used in money transactions. It is not a one-size-fits-all framework. In the context of Chinese workers and American workers, how is their social or cultural difference relevant to the factory working floor? In that context, both the workers are equal as long they are equally productive.  In the context of entrance examinations, two candidates are not equal according to some people. And those who make the argument in favour of merit assume that the two candidates are equal. I do not see how my framework violates any fundamental principle here. It can be used only when the two parties are considered equal. Whether or not they are indeed equal is a different debate altogether. I do not see anything wrong with my framework itself.]]></description>
