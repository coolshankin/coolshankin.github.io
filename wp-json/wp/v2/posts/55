A couple of hours of googling <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">and wiki-ing was good enough to collect all the information I needed. Almost all the pictures here <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">can easily convince you that a picture paints a thousand words.<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/2671\/873\/1600\/afghangirl.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/2671\/873\/320\/afghangirl.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">The photograph above, by Steve McCurry, can easily be recognised as it was much hyped by <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">National Geographic Channel. The haunting green eyes of the girl haunted the whole world since <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">the time it appeared on National Geographic Magazine cover in 1985. It is the first picture that <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">come to our minds when talking about refugees. Torn apart by civil war, the plight of refugees was <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">brought forward to the rest of the world through this very photograph.

The shocking picture of a sever year old girl &#8216;resting&#8217; for a while before going to the refugee <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">shelter for food being stalked by a plump vulture brought attention to the gravity of Sudan&#8217;s famine <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">in 1993-94. The photographer managed to shoo the vulture away, but no one knows what <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">happened <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">to this little girl. Burdened by the sight of so many sufferings in Africa, the photographer <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">committed <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">suicide 3 months after the photograph was shot. In his note, he says &#8220;I am depressed &#8230; without <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">phone &#8230; money for rent &#8230; money for child support &#8230; money for debts &#8230; money!!! &#8230; I am <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">haunted by the vivid memories of killings &amp; corpses &amp; anger &amp; pain &#8230; of starving or wounded <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">children, of trigger-happy madmen, often police, of killer executioners&#8230;I have gone to join Ken if I <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">am that lucky.&#8221; More info. <a style=\"color: #000099;\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kevin_Carter\">here<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/2671\/873\/1600\/image_662678.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/2671\/873\/320\/image_662678.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">This pic. is in the forefront of all anti-war campaigns.

Gen. Nguyen Ngoc Loan executes a Viet Cong <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">officer with a shot to the head, one of the most chilling images of the Vietnam War. Photographer <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Eddie Adams, who won a Pulitzer Prize for this photograph, said the execution was justified, <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">because the Viet Cong officer had killed eight South Vietnamese. The furor created by this 1968 <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">image destroyed Loan&#8217;s life. He fled South Vietnam in 1975, the year the communists overran the <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">country, and moved to Virginia, where he opened a restaurant. He died in 1998 at age 67. Loan <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">&#8216;was a hero,&#8217; Adams said when he died. &#8216;America should be crying.

When this young man simply <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">would not move, standing with his meager bags before a line of tanks, a hero was born. A second <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">hero emerged as the tank driver refused to crush the man, and instead drove his killing machine <\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial;\">around him.
