Being kept away from television, I hadn\u2019t seen ads for a year. This post is a sequel to a <a style=\"color: #336666;\" href=\"http:\/\/coolshankin.blogspot.com\/2005\/07\/after-while.html\">post<\/a> of mine about a year ago. This year, I was surprised that Pepsi and Coke did not come up with ads lashing out at each other as fervently as they did years before. Also, the quality of ads were not as good as they used to be. I can only name a handful of ads which are worth a mention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Monster com\u2019s ad about \u2018being caught in the wrong job\u2019, in my opinion, is the best ad of the summer. Unlike jobsahead\u2019s rather pessimistic ad campaign of taking about its site when a batsman gets out, both naukri and monster have chosen an optimistic (a better) outlook. Naukri\u2019s \u201cHari Sadu\u201d ad (H for Hitler \u2026) is a close match to the monsters. Over the years as well, these two companies have come up with good ads like \u201cAladdin: he is gonna be rich\u201d among others. I think positive tone to the ads is very important in luring people to such sites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">HSBC\u2019s \u2018world local bank\u2019 ad and the slogan \u2018understanding your needs better\u2019 is yet another example on how abstract advertising is a great idea. A simple issue like torn jeans being stylish for the daughter and a completely opposite view of the mother brings about the idea that the bank changes according to <i>your<\/i> need. Earlier this summer, HSBC floated another ad (animated) with months of years making up a car or a house. Though it would have made a great idea for a hoarding, it was ordinary on television.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Sania Mirza\u2019s question-answer session turned out to be one of those \u2018good-to-watch-ones-irritating-the-next-time\u2019 ads. The worst in the bag of soft drink ads was Aamir Khan\u2019s \u2018<i>thanda samosa\u2019 <\/i>ad<i>.<\/i> It is unlike soft drink manufacturers not to come up with good ads especially during summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Running up to the foot ball world cup, several ads were featured on football. Adidas ad on two young boys choosing their teams has a <a style=\"color: #000099;\" href=\"http:\/\/ubiquitousbystander.blogspot.com\/2006\/07\/what-ad.html\">touch of brilliance<\/a>. Also in the context is a well done ad by Maruti Swift, the one with the car playing around with the foot ball. There was one more ad by adidas or nike in which a foot ball is passed around in two lifts until a trophy is captured using the ball. That was choreographed extremely well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Again, the ads by soaps, shampoos and detergents haven\u2019t explored outside their domain. There are as boring as they can get. It can only take a genius to come up with \u2018<i>nihar mein hai kudrat ki sakhi<\/i>\u2019 for a coconut oil product. We will have to wait and watch before any other product comes up with ideas like that. Till my next vacations, no more television ads on this blog.<\/span><!--\/codes_iframe--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over this summer, I had access to what we usually don\u2019t, television.
