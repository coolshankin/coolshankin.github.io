It was scheduled on Monday following the diwali weekend. Even before the request letter signed by freshies read the mathematics department, the authorities turned the request down (as far as I have been informed). In my opinion, the request was quite a legitimate one. After all, diwali is the most celebrated and biggest festival in the country. If students want to have a good time, I don\u2019t understand their problem. I\u2019m sure that no American or English Universities schedule their tests right after Christmas. The holiday season is what it is supposed to be &#8211; Holidays. What is annoying is the fact that it is the same authorities who complain about brain drain later at a different occasion. How the hell can\u2019t such a simple request be fulfilled? If the \u201cbrain\u201d is not even allowed to enjoy what rest of country takes for granted, you can\u2019t blame them for trying to get out of this place.<span style=\"font-family: arial;\">It is not an isolated incident that I am complaining about. We have had Industrial Design test to write on Gandhi Jayanthi. We have been forced to write Engineering Drawing Exams right after sweating it out on Fitting Workshop for four hours. There was one lab in which the in-charge wouldn\u2019t let us switch on the fan or open the windows (it was close to 40oC) because it would affect our readings. None of us could see how though, it was a completely enclosed system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">There are always those Profs who demand respect rather than command it. Somehow the \u201cIndian culture\u201d put a teacher on a pedestal. From what elders have told me, \u201cThey ought to be respected, no questions asked.\u201d Such a respect is not advised to any other profession. That leaves a little wonder why there isn\u2019t any dignity of labour in our country. A \u2018level\u2019 of a cobbler, for instance, will remain low forever because no one ever asks anyone to respect them. But a teacher, oh no, they have to be respected. I may be grossly wrong here, but from what I see, over the ages Brahmins have been teachers and are always respected simply because they are teachers. After thousand of years, we cannot wonder how the whole social (caste) hierarchy came into existence. We are not taught to respect anyone on how well they do their job but on what they do, no matter how miserable they perform their job. Why isn\u2019t it clear to some teachers that students are going to respect them provided they teach well, and not just because they are teachers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Over my stay in school, every year I have seen some teachers who tried be \u201cforgiving\u201d to students on their birthdays. They tell them, \u201cI am letting you go because it\u2019s your birthday, otherwise \u2026.\u201d Come on! It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that the birthday is effectively ruined. Thankfully, I have never been at the receiving end of this, but some of my friends were. Let me not get started on beating (read physical torture) that some of the teachers in my school were \u201cfamous\u201d for. Also, every one of us would have been victim of imposition sometime or the other during elementary schooling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">My friends have their exams in Bangalore starting the day after Christmas. Perhaps, the authorities find Christmas and New Year parties against Indian Culture. Whatever the reason, these people (like Mathematics dept.) have forfeited their right to talk against brain-drain as such people are driving cause for brain-drain to begin with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">And yes, before I forget, lemme tell you that Pizza and other delivery people cannot come into our campus. It is not that they cause nuisance in the campus, there are tones of other vehicles coming in and going out everyday but because it\u2019s a residential zone. There is a gate through which the bikes don\u2019t have go through the residential zone, and can reach all the hostels. But even that is a big deal for authorities here to allow them to come in. This issue, hopefully, will be resolved soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Please note that I am not saying many teacher, Profs and authorities are that way. In fact, I respect, in the true sense of the word, almost all teacher who have taught me, not out of compulsion but because they do a good job. There are those few who, unfortunately, make life difficult for us when all it takes is a little effort to make it simpler. And I don\u2019t respect such people no matter what their profession is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">To end on a positive note, our Mathematics Prof had absolutely no problem in postponing the test for a week. All it took was an oral request. \ud83d\ude42 <\/span><br \/>\n<!--\/codes_iframe--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Earlier last month, there was a request made by freshies in my college about a mathematics test being postponed by a week so that it doesn\u2019t fall right after the diwali hols.
