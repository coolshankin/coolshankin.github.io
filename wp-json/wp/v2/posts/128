Why is he not on the streets for gitmo (where torture is carried out in the name of America&#8217;s security)?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q2.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Muslims are not victims because <em>only<\/em> 8% of crimes are anti-islam. By the same logic, America is not a victim because only a small percentage of people who have died of terrorism are Americans (<a title=\"Terror statistic\" href=\"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/s\/ct\/rls\/crt\/2009\/140902.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link<\/a>).
