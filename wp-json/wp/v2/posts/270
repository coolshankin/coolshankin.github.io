Many of you may have simple framework based on free market principles to judge a transaction as fair or unfair. I have a different framework that is based on equality. This post should be read from a philosophical standpoint and not from a practical or enforcement standpoint.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Two\u00a0Transactions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I will present two transactions to you. Both of them follow free market principles. I would like you to judge if these transaction are fair. First, a rich businessman\u00a0approaches several equally rich engineers and arrives at $200 as a price for a job, which is given to least expensive engineer. Second, knowing that the price of the job was $200, the businessman goes to a poorer,\u00a0desperate\u00a0(for tangential reasons) engineers. The\u00a0businessman\u00a0uses the poorer engineers&#8217; lack of bargaining power to\u00a0establish\u00a0$50 as the price for the same job. All the engineers are equally skilled and efficient at the job. My question is: do you think the second transaction was fair? If the businessman goes to the poorer engineers first and then to the richer ones, are the same transactions fair?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fairness<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you argue that the all\u00a0transactions\u00a0were fair\u00a0because they were all mutually agreed upon by the parties involved (free market economics), I respect your judgement, but I disagree with it. I think that fairness and free market\u00a0principle\u00a0are different entities altogether. I think that free market is just one of the many possible systems to distribute capital and resources.<\/p>\n<p>My framework to judge fairness is based on equality. If the businessman *knowingly* exploits the lack of the bargaining power, which has got nothing to do with the job, I think that he is being unfair. You may ask me how I know that $200 is the &#8220;real&#8221; price for the job. The key term in my definition is &#8220;knowingly.&#8221; If the businessman\u00a0genuinely thought that $200 was too much, and that $50 is reasonable, I wouldn&#8217;t call it unfair.\u00a0In the second case, where the businessman approaches\u00a0the poorer engineers first, he does not really know the price of the job, and so he negotiates the best he can. I wouldn&#8217;t call that unfair either.\u00a0We assume here that the businessman used his bargaining position, which had no relation to the job, to treat people in different ways. Fairness goes the other way too. If the engineers were to treat different businessmen\u00a0differently, I would call them unfair too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What if it Happens to You?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would like to put the same question in the context of your employer. Suppose your boss knows that you and \u00a0your colleague are both equally productive and\u00a0equally\u00a0valuable to the company. And he also *knows* that you are desperate\u00a0to keep this job. Perhaps, you and your spouse \u00a0just had a baby, and cannot afford to change health\u00a0insurance\u00a0plans, while your colleague \u00a0can afford to quit the job and look for a new one because he has a richer ancestry. Or, perhaps, your\u00a0colleague\u00a0may be as\u00a0desperate\u00a0a you are.\u00a0If your boss decides that only your colleague gets a bonus for no reason (your boss tells you so), would you still call that fair? Remember that reason why he decided to treat you unequally had nothing do your job, but other tangential reason, and everything here follows free market principles; you are free to walk away from your job if you don&#8217;t like the salary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Personal Confession<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I knew that the previous owner from whom I bought my car was going out of country in a few days. So I used that information to lower the price I paid for the car. In my opinion, I was being unfair to him because the value of the car had got nothing do with his going abroad. Will I be unfair next time I am a part of such transactions? I think I will be. I am not taking a moral highground. I think that the social cost of my unfair actions is not very high. I hope I will be less selfish if the social costs are high.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Relevance\u00a0to Foxconn, Walmart and Apple<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Clearly, everyone knows that Chinese workers are more\u00a0desperate\u00a0for work. The companies use this to exploit them. I have read many posts online that explain that it is fair because it follows free market principles, and that their life is better off as a result. I have to disagree with that reasoning. No one would complain if the employees has a decent standard of living. But we all know that condition of workers in Foxconn (<a title=\"Foxconn (ABC News)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hLuPtMvvwA0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link<\/a>) and Walmart (<a title=\"Walmart: The high cost of low price\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Hftb_DVuelo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link<\/a>). The companies are not doing the worker a favour by giving them the job. It is business transaction in which the workers are being treated worse thay should be (based on my framework on fairness). The social cost of their actions is very high. That is the reason why their practices are frowned upon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Practical?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I realise that enforcing my idea of fairness is not practical. Walmart can simply say that they genuinely\u00a0believe that their worker do deserve health insurance. This is where government\u00a0mandates\u00a0come into play. I am not a fan of ideas that imply fairness if all rules are followed (government rules or otherwise). How would you decide if the rules are themselves fair? I think a judgement on what is fair should not have external dependence because it is a personal moral compass.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other Frameworks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have not had the time to read any of the following wiki links or books to which they refer.
