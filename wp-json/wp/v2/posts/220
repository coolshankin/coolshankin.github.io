My opinion, based on the current global context, is that it is not correct. In this post, I will explain why. This is mainly in response to Great Bong&#8217;s post (<a title=\"The Big Hearts, a post by Great Bong\" href=\"http:\/\/greatbong.net\/2011\/04\/05\/the-big-hearts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link<\/a>), in which he holds the opposite view. I respect his opinion as long as he is consistant. I will also relate this to blaming every bank employee (in Goldman Sachs etc.) for the banks&#8217; role in the global economic crisis.<\/p>\n<p>A view held by many is that the citizens on the country are ultimately responsible for the actions of the government. Thus, any state-sponsored activity, including terrorism, can be blamed upon every individual from the country. In theory, the government is suppose to reflect the views of the majority in the country, and therefore, the actions of the governments are indicative of the mass opinion in the country. I respect this view, but do not agree with it.<\/p>\n<p>I question that basic premise of the argument that the government reflects the views of the majority. I have seen overwhelming evidence off-late that most democratically-elected governments today are plutocracies. First, there was the plutocracy memo (<a title=\"Leaked Citigroup Plutocracy Memo\" href=\"http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/6674234\/Citigroup-Oct-16-2005-Plutonomy-Report-Part-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link<\/a>) by the Citigroup. Second, I read this Al Jazeera article on the power of lobbying in the US (<a title=\"It's plutocracy, stupid: Al Jazeera column\" href=\"http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/indepth\/opinion\/2011\/04\/20114391843209245.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link<\/a>). These pieces, among others, make me believe that common man has absolutely no voice in the governance of the country because he does not belong to the elite. Is my vote really worth a billionth of the value of all billion Indian voters put together? Regardless of what most of the country thinks, it is the wealth-driven lobbies, which dictate the domestic and foreign policy. That is disturbing.<\/p>\n<p>Also, when we accuse a nation of being immoral, we should be willing to accept similar, well-reasoned aspersions on us. Let&#8217;s take Kashmir and the Northeastern India as examples, where our lawmakers have wrecked havok. We have rigged elections in Kashmir (<a title=\"Kashmir's flawed elections: BBC News\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/2223364.stm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link<\/a>) and misused Armed Force Special Provision Act (AFSPA) in Kashmir and the Northeastern India (<a title=\"Al Jazeera: The disappeared of Kashmir\" href=\"http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/indepth\/features\/2011\/04\/201141710204769839.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link<\/a>) (Also look my post on Kashmir (<a title=\"On Kashmir Issue: A post on this blog\" href=\"http:\/\/www.coolshankin.com\/blog\/2010\/09\/29\/on-kashmir-issue\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link<\/a>)).Based on these irresponsible acts, a Kashmiri or a Manipuri can easily label the rest of the nation as traitors. I am personally not responsible for these acts by our government. We all blame it on factors beyond our control such as the politicians and their vote-bank politics. Just like how I am not willing to take criticism for the atrocities my government commits (maybe, I ought to accept those criticisms), I do not want to blame another nation in entirety for actions of a few individuals of their government.<\/p>\n<p>I apply the same moral compass in blaming bankers working for big banks for the sub-prime crisis. The contempt against the big banks for their hand in the crisis is well justified (<a title=\"Goldman Sachs Ripped Off And Misled Clients, Senate Report Says: HuffPo\" href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2011\/04\/15\/goldman-sachs-levin-investigation_n_849708.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link<\/a>). But are we right in holding every individual who work in these firms responsible for the chaos? I assume that it is an &#8220;elite few&#8221; at the top who made those decisions that led to the downfall. Most worker have had no role in the crisis. Thus, I do not hold every banker accountable for the crisis.<\/p>\n<p>There is one point for which I don&#8217;t have an answer. You may argue that the bankers have a choice to quit their job and work elsewhere. I think that&#8217;s a fair point. But I also think about the reality of their choice. After a fairly-long career, changing domains is not easy. The real choice is between a great lifestyle and being unemployed for a long time. Should one&#8217;s values be strong enough to punish oneself by being unemployed for no fault of their own?<\/p>\n<p>This post appeared as a column in The Viewspaper (<a title=\"Casting Aspersions: The Viewpaper\" href=\"http:\/\/theviewspaper.net\/casting-aspersions\/\">link<\/a>)<!--\/codes_iframe--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is it right to question the integrity of people of a country based on what their democratically-elected government does?
